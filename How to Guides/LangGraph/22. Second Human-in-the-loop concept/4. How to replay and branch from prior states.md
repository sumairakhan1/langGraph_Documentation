# How to Replay and Branch from Prior States in LangGraph Cloud 🌐

LangGraph Cloud offers powerful features to manage states, allowing you to *replay* and *branch* from prior states in your graphs. This can help with debugging, reproducing issues, or experimenting with different paths in your workflows. Let’s dive deeper into how this works with examples, and we’ll also discuss how to use this feature in real-world applications.

## What Does "Replay and Branching" Mean? 🔄🌱

### Replay
Replaying a state allows you to **revisit a past point in your workflow** and run the same actions again. It’s useful for testing or reproducing issues you encountered previously without having to manually replicate the steps.

### Branching
Branching lets you **create alternate versions** from a particular point in the workflow, offering the flexibility to explore different options or paths without changing the original graph.

## Real-World Example of Replay and Branching 🌎

Imagine you're building a chatbot that helps users check the weather. During testing, you notice an error in the tool call (fetching weather data). With replay, you can go back to the state right before the tool was called, reproduce the error, and debug it. After resolving the issue, branching lets you modify how the tool is called, explore a different way of fetching weather, or change the chatbot’s responses, all without affecting the original process.

## Setup 🔧

Before we start, we need to set up the environment to interact with LangGraph Cloud. Here’s how you can initialize the SDK and create a thread for our example.

### SDK Initialization

First, initialize the SDK client:

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

# Initialize the client to communicate with the hosted graph
client = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)

# Define the assistant's ID and create a new thread
assistant_id = "agent"
thread = await client.threads.create()
```

**Explanation:**
- `get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)`: This connects your script to the hosted LangGraph instance.
- `assistant_id = "agent"`: Specifies the name of the graph or assistant you're working with.
- `thread = await client.threads.create()`: Creates a new thread for the conversation or task.

## Replay a State 🎬

### Initial Invocation

Before replaying a state, we need to create the states. Let’s start by invoking the graph with a simple query: “Please search the weather in SF.”

```python
input = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please search the weather in SF"}]}

# Stream the results from the graph
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input=input,
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    if chunk.data and chunk.event != "metadata":
        print(chunk.data)
```

**Explanation:**
- `input`: This is the message we send to the graph, asking for the weather in San Francisco.
- `client.runs.stream(...)`: Starts streaming the graph's response, showing each update in real time.
- We only print the `chunk.data` if it's valid (not metadata).

### Output:
The output shows the results of the query, including the assistant's response and any tool calls made (e.g., fetching weather data).

### Get States and Replay 🎥

Once the graph has completed its task, we can view the list of states and replay from a previous one.

```python
states = await client.threads.get_history(thread['thread_id'])

# Find the state to replay (right before tool was called)
state_to_replay = states[2]
print(state_to_replay['next'])

# Re-run from the selected state
updated_config = await client.threads.update_state(
    thread["thread_id"],
    {"messages": []},
    checkpoint_id=state_to_replay["checkpoint_id"]
)

async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input=None,
    stream_mode="updates",
    checkpoint_id=updated_config["checkpoint_id"]
):
    if chunk.data and chunk.event != "metadata":
        print(chunk.data)
```

**Explanation:**
- `states = await client.threads.get_history(...)`: Retrieves the historical states of the thread.
- `state_to_replay = states[2]`: Selects a specific state to replay (just before a tool was called).
- `updated_config`: Updates the state and replays it, starting from the selected checkpoint.

## Branch from Prior States 🌱

You can also branch from a state to explore alternate paths. For example, let’s change the input for a tool call and run it from that new state.

```python
# Retrieve the last message from the selected state
last_message = state_to_replay['values']['messages'][-1]

# Update the arguments for the tool call
last_message['tool_calls'][0]['args'] = {'query': 'current weather in SF'}

# Update the state with the new message
config = await client.threads.update_state(
    thread['thread_id'],
    {"messages": [last_message]},
    checkpoint_id=state_to_replay['checkpoint_id']
)

# Stream the graph's response from the updated state
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input=None,
    stream_mode="updates",
    checkpoint_id=config['checkpoint_id']
):
    if chunk.data and chunk.event != "metadata":
        print(chunk.data)
```

**Explanation:**
- `last_message['tool_calls'][0]['args']`: Updates the tool call arguments, changing the query from “San Francisco” to “SF.”
- `config`: The updated state now includes the modified tool call.
- The graph is rerun from this updated state, resulting in a different output based on the new query.

## Summary and Use Cases 🚀

### Key Points:
- **Replay** allows you to revisit and re-run previous states in your workflow for debugging or testing.
- **Branching** enables you to create new paths from an earlier state, modifying specific parts of the process.
- Both features help improve experimentation, debugging, and workflow flexibility.

### Real-World Use Case:
In **chatbots or customer service automation**, replaying and branching from past interactions allows the bot to adapt to different user inputs or troubleshoot errors. For example, a bot can revisit a state where an incorrect answer was given and retry the task with adjusted parameters, or branch to provide alternative solutions based on user feedback.

By understanding how to replay and branch from prior states, you can add immense flexibility to your LangGraph-powered applications, whether you're debugging, optimizing, or experimenting with new paths in your workflows.
