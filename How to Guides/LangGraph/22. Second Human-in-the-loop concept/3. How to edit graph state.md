# üßë‚Äçüíª How to Edit State of a Deployed Graph in LangGraph

In this guide, we'll explore how to edit the state of a deployed LangGraph agent, focusing on how to interact with a graph before it executes a node. This is particularly useful when we want to change the behavior of the graph or modify the input to a tool.

### üöÄ **Purpose of Editing State**

Editing the state of a graph allows you to modify the execution flow of an agent's task. This is especially helpful when you're using tools within a graph and want to adjust things dynamically, such as changing the input for a tool or updating a piece of data before it is processed. This "human-in-the-loop" capability can be very powerful for ensuring that the agent operates based on the most up-to-date information, or adjusting the agent's behavior as it runs.

For example, imagine you're creating an AI assistant for weather queries. The assistant might initially search for the weather in San Francisco but could be given the wrong city due to an ambiguous input. You can intercept the request before the assistant executes the search, change the city name, and then resume the operation with the correct state.

### üõ† **How It Works: Step-by-Step**

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how you can edit the state of a deployed graph, with real-world examples and code snippets.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **SDK Initialization**

First, you need to set up the SDK client to communicate with the hosted graph. This is the connection between your local environment (where the agent is running) and the deployed graph. 

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client
client = get_client(url="<DEPLOYMENT_URL>")
assistant_id = "agent"  # the identifier for your assistant
thread = await client.threads.create()
```

In the above code:
- We‚Äôre initializing the client to connect to the graph at the given deployment URL.
- We create a new thread, which is like an ongoing conversation or task with the assistant.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Editing the State Before a Node**

Before a node executes, you can interrupt the graph‚Äôs flow to update its state. For instance, if the agent is about to call a tool (e.g., searching for weather), you can stop it at that point, modify the parameters, and then resume.

```python
input = { 'messages': [{ "role": "user", "content": "search for weather in SF" }] }

async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input=input,
    stream_mode="updates",
    interrupt_before=["action"],
):
    if chunk.data and chunk.event != "metadata": 
        print(chunk.data)
```

In this example:
- We send an initial user input asking the assistant to "search for weather in SF."
- The `interrupt_before=["action"]` option ensures that the execution halts before the action node is triggered, allowing us to modify the state.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Modifying the State**

After interrupting the process, you can grab the current state and update the tool call parameters to correct any errors or make adjustments based on new information.

```python
# Get the current state
current_state = await client.threads.get_state(thread['thread_id'])

# Get the last message, which includes the tool call
last_message = current_state['values']['messages'][-1]

# Update the tool call parameters to correct the city
last_message['tool_calls'][0]['args'] = {'query': 'current weather in Sidi Frej'}

# Update the state
await client.threads.update_state(thread['thread_id'], {"messages": last_message})
```

In this example:
- We fetch the current state of the thread, which contains the information about what the agent is about to do.
- We update the tool call (search query) to look for weather in "Sidi Frej" instead of "SF" (San Francisco).
- We call `update_state` to apply this new state to the thread, effectively modifying the graph's behavior.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Resuming the Graph Execution**

Once the state is updated, you can resume the execution of the graph with the new state, and the agent will continue its task using the modified input.

```python
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input=None,
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    if chunk.data and chunk.event != "metadata": 
        print(chunk.data)
```

In this final step:
- We call `stream` again to continue the execution of the graph with the updated state.
- The agent will now process the new tool call (searching for weather in "Sidi Frej") and resume its work.

### üìù **Real-World Use Case Example**

Imagine you're building an AI assistant that helps users search for specific locations. However, sometimes users may type ambiguous inputs, such as "SF" for San Francisco, but the system mistakenly interprets it as another city with the same initials, like "Sidi Frej." By editing the state before the assistant performs its search, you can prevent incorrect results and make sure the agent performs the search with the correct location.

#### Use Case in a Smart Assistant:

- **Before Edit:** The assistant is about to search for weather in "SF" (San Francisco).
- **Interrupt:** You notice that "SF" could mean Sidi Frej, so you pause the execution.
- **Edit State:** You update the query to specify "Sidi Frej" instead.
- **Resume:** The assistant performs the search with the correct location and gives the user accurate results.

### üß† **Alternative Examples of State Editing**

Here are three more examples of when you might need to edit the state:

1. **AI Assistant Learning:**
   - A virtual assistant might learn from user feedback and adjust its responses in real-time. You could update its state to reflect new information that was provided during the interaction.

2. **Real-time Adjustments in Automated Workflows:**
   - In a business workflow, if an automation script is performing a task like email sending, you could intercept the execution at a certain node and adjust parameters like the recipient's address or the subject line based on updated information before the email is sent.

3. **Interactive Storytelling:**
   - In an interactive AI storytelling app, where the plot changes based on user decisions, the state might need to be adjusted whenever a user provides a new choice, allowing the story to adapt in real-time.

### üéØ **Key Takeaways**

- **State Editing** is a useful tool when you need to dynamically adjust the parameters or behavior of a deployed graph.
- **Interrupting Execution** before specific nodes allows you to make changes to the state before the graph continues.
- This technique can be used in real-world applications like weather assistants, automated workflows, or AI learning systems to ensure better accuracy and adaptability.

### üìå **Conclusion**

Editing the state of a deployed LangGraph is a powerful technique that can help you adjust an agent‚Äôs behavior in real-time. By using interrupts and state updates, you can refine the actions taken by your agent, correct errors, and provide a better user experience.
