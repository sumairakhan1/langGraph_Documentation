# 4. How to build a multi-agent network (functional API)

Here’s a detailed breakdown of how to build a **multi-agent network using the Functional API** in LangGraph. I'll explain each concept step-by-step, provide real-world applications, and go over the code with explanations so even a beginner can understand.

# 🧠 **How to Build a Multi-Agent Network Using the Functional API**

A **multi-agent network** is a system where multiple agents (AI models, programs, or entities) can interact, collaborate, and make decisions based on inputs. In this guide, we will build a network where each agent can communicate with every other agent and decide which one to call next.

We will implement:
✔️ **Agents as tasks**  
✔️ **Many-to-many agent communication**  
✔️ **Dynamic decision-making on which agent to call next**  

---

## 🎯 **Real-World Use Cases**
A multi-agent network can be used in:
🔹 **Customer Support Chatbots** – Different bots for billing, technical issues, and general queries can communicate.  
🔹 **AI-driven Travel Assistance** – One AI agent suggests destinations, another recommends hotels, and another finds flights.  
🔹 **Healthcare Assistance** – AI doctors and specialists can refer cases to the right virtual expert.  

---

## ⚙️ **Step 1: Install Required Packages**
Before we start, ensure you have the required libraries installed. Run the following:

```python
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-anthropic
```

We also need an API key for **Anthropic’s Claude** model. Set it up securely:

```python
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

🔹 **Why are we using `getpass.getpass()`?**  
This ensures our API key is **not exposed in plain text** when running the code.

---

## 🏨 **Step 2: Defining Agent Tools**
Each agent will have **tools** (functions) that define what they can do.

```python
import random
from typing_extensions import Literal
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def get_travel_recommendations():
    """Get recommendation for travel destinations"""
    return random.choice(["Aruba", "Turks and Caicos"])

@tool
def get_hotel_recommendations(location: Literal["Aruba", "Turks and Caicos"]):
    """Get hotel recommendations for a given destination."""
    return {
        "Aruba": ["The Ritz-Carlton, Aruba", "Bucuti & Tara Beach Resort"],
        "Turks and Caicos": ["Grace Bay Club", "COMO Parrot Cay"],
    }[location]

@tool(return_direct=True)
def transfer_to_hotel_advisor():
    """Ask hotel advisor agent for help."""
    return "Successfully transferred to hotel advisor"

@tool(return_direct=True)
def transfer_to_travel_advisor():
    """Ask travel advisor agent for help."""
    return "Successfully transferred to travel advisor"
```

### 🔹 **Explanation:**
- `@tool` – Marks the function as a tool that agents can use.  
- `get_travel_recommendations()` – Returns a random destination.  
- `get_hotel_recommendations(location)` – Returns a list of hotels based on the given location.  
- `transfer_to_hotel_advisor()` – Allows switching between agents.  
- **`return_direct=True`** ensures immediate transfer of control when switching agents.

---

## 🧑‍✈️ **Step 3: Defining the AI Agents**
Now, we create **two AI agents**:  
1️⃣ **Travel Advisor** – Suggests destinations and transfers to the hotel advisor.  
2️⃣ **Hotel Advisor** – Suggests hotels and transfers back to the travel advisor.

```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

# Define travel advisor agent
travel_advisor_tools = [get_travel_recommendations, transfer_to_hotel_advisor]

travel_advisor = create_react_agent(
    model,
    travel_advisor_tools,
    state_modifier=(
        "You are a general travel expert that can recommend travel destinations. "
        "If you need hotel recommendations, ask 'hotel_advisor' for help. "
        "You MUST include human-readable response before transferring to another agent."
    ),
)

# Define hotel advisor agent
hotel_advisor_tools = [get_hotel_recommendations, transfer_to_travel_advisor]

hotel_advisor = create_react_agent(
    model,
    hotel_advisor_tools,
    state_modifier=(
        "You are a hotel expert that provides hotel recommendations. "
        "If you need travel recommendations, ask 'travel_advisor' for help. "
        "You MUST include human-readable response before transferring to another agent."
    ),
)
```

### 🔹 **Explanation:**
- **`ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")`** – Uses **Claude AI** from Anthropic.  
- **`create_react_agent(model, tools, state_modifier)`** – Creates an agent with specific tools and behavior.  
- **`state_modifier`** – Defines the **agent’s role and behavior**.  

---

## 🔁 **Step 4: Defining Task Functions**
Now we create **tasks** that allow agents to communicate.

```python
from langgraph.func import task

@task
def call_travel_advisor(messages):
    response = travel_advisor.invoke({"messages": messages})
    return response["messages"]

@task
def call_hotel_advisor(messages):
    response = hotel_advisor.invoke({"messages": messages})
    return response["messages"]
```

### 🔹 **Explanation:**
- **`@task`** – Marks these as callable tasks inside the workflow.  
- **`invoke({"messages": messages})`** – Sends user messages to the agent and receives responses.  

---

## 🔗 **Step 5: Building the Multi-Agent Workflow**
Now, we set up the **workflow** that manages how agents interact.

```python
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage
from langgraph.graph import add_messages
from langgraph.func import entrypoint

@entrypoint()
def workflow(messages):
    messages = add_messages([], messages)

    call_active_agent = call_travel_advisor
    while True:
        agent_messages = call_active_agent(messages).result()
        messages = add_messages(messages, agent_messages)

        ai_msg = next(m for m in reversed(agent_messages) if isinstance(m, AIMessage))
        if not ai_msg.tool_calls:
            break

        tool_call = ai_msg.tool_calls[-1]
        if tool_call["name"] == "transfer_to_travel_advisor":
            call_active_agent = call_travel_advisor
        elif tool_call["name"] == "transfer_to_hotel_advisor":
            call_active_agent = call_hotel_advisor
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unexpected tool call: {tool_call['name']}")

    return messages
```

### 🔹 **Explanation:**
- **`@entrypoint()`** – Defines the main workflow.  
- **`call_active_agent = call_travel_advisor`** – Starts with the **travel advisor**.  
- **Loop Execution:**
  - Calls the current agent.
  - Checks if the agent is transferring control.
  - Switches to the next agent accordingly.
  - Stops when no more tool calls are made.  

---

## 📜 **Step 6: Pretty Print Agent Outputs**
To display agent interactions nicely:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messages

def pretty_print_messages(update):
    if isinstance(update, tuple):
        ns, update = update
        if len(ns) == 0:
            return

        graph_id = ns[-1].split(":")[0]
        print(f"Update from subgraph {graph_id}:\n")

    for node_name, node_update in update.items():
        print(f"Update from node {node_name}:\n")

        for m in convert_to_messages(node_update["messages"]):
            m.pretty_print()
        print("\n")
```

---

## 🚀 **Step 7: Running the Multi-Agent System**
Finally, test the system with a user input.

```python
for chunk in workflow.stream(
    [{"role": "user", "content": "I want to go somewhere warm in the Caribbean. Suggest a destination and hotels."}],
    subgraphs=True,
):
    pretty_print_messages(chunk)
```

🔹 **This will:**
- Let **travel advisor** pick a destination.
- Transfer control to **hotel advisor** for hotel suggestions.
- Display responses step-by-step.

---

## ✅ **Final Thoughts**
- 🎯 We built a **multi-agent AI system** where agents interact dynamically.
- 🔄 Agents **transfer control** based on needs.
- 🌍 Useful for **customer support, travel, healthcare, and automation**.

# 🚀 How to Build a Multi-Agent Network (Functional API)

In this guide, we'll learn how to create a **multi-agent network** using a **functional API**. This network lets individual agents communicate with each other (many-to-many connections) and decide which agent to call next—all defined as tasks in a central workflow. We'll walk through each step with code examples and detailed explanations so that even beginners can follow along.

---

## 📖 Overview

**What is a Multi-Agent Network?**  
A multi-agent network is an architecture where several specialized agents work together. Each agent is responsible for a particular task (e.g., recommending travel destinations or hotels) and can hand off control to another agent based on the conversation context.

**Real-World Example:**  
Imagine a travel assistant chatbot:
- **Travel Advisor:** Recommends destinations (e.g., "Aruba" or "Turks and Caicos").
- **Hotel Advisor:** Provides hotel recommendations.
  
If a user asks, "I want a warm Caribbean destination and hotel recommendations," the **Travel Advisor** can first suggest a destination. Then, using a **handoff tool**, it transfers control to the **Hotel Advisor** to offer hotel details.

---

## 🛠️ Key Components of the Functional API

1. **Tools:** Functions marked with `@tool` that can be invoked by agents to perform specific actions.  
2. **Agents:** Created using `create_react_agent` that leverage tools and a language model (e.g., ChatAnthropic).  
3. **Tasks:** Wrap the agent calls into tasks using the `@task` decorator.  
4. **Workflow (Entrypoint):** A central function (marked with `@entrypoint()`) that orchestrates the multi-agent communication by invoking tasks and handling handoffs.

---

## 🔄 Code Example & Detailed Explanation

Below is a complete example to build a multi-agent network using a functional API.

### 1. **Import Dependencies and Define Tools**

```python
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_core.tools import tool
import random
from typing_extensions import Literal
```

**Explanation:**
- **`entrypoint` & `task`**: Decorators from LangGraph for defining workflow entrypoints and tasks.
- **`create_react_agent`**: A prebuilt method to create an agent using the ReAct framework.
- **`@tool`**: Decorator to define tools that agents use.
- **`random` and `Literal`**: Standard modules for randomness and type hinting.

---

### 2. **Define Transfer (Handoff) Tools**

These tools signal an intent to transfer control from one agent to another.

```python
@tool(return_direct=True)
def transfer_to_hotel_advisor():
    """Ask hotel advisor agent for help."""
    return "Successfully transferred to hotel advisor"

@tool(return_direct=True)
def transfer_to_travel_advisor():
    """Ask travel advisor agent for help."""
    return "Successfully transferred to travel advisor"
```

**Explanation:**
- **`@tool(return_direct=True)`**: Marks these functions as tools that exit the ReAct loop immediately when called.
- **Return Messages**: They return a direct message indicating the transfer. This allows the system to recognize and hand off control.

---

### 3. **Create Agent Instances**

We will create agents for travel advice and hotel recommendations.

#### **Travel Advisor Agent**

```python
# Define travel advisor tools
travel_advisor_tools = [
    transfer_to_hotel_advisor,  # Handoff tool to call hotel advisor
    # You can include more tools like get_travel_recommendations, etc.
]

# Create a travel advisor agent using the prebuilt ReAct agent
travel_advisor = create_react_agent(
    model,  # your language model instance (e.g., ChatAnthropic)
    travel_advisor_tools,
    state_modifier=(
        "You are a general travel expert that can recommend travel destinations (e.g. countries, cities, etc). "
        "If you need hotel recommendations, ask 'hotel_advisor' for help. "
        "You MUST include human-readable response before transferring to another agent."
    ),
)
```

**Explanation:**
- **`travel_advisor_tools`**: A list of tools the travel advisor agent can use.
- **`create_react_agent`**: This function creates an agent that interacts with the language model using the specified tools and prompt.
- **`state_modifier`**: Provides instructions to the agent about its role and behavior.

#### **Hotel Advisor Agent**

```python
# Define hotel advisor tools
hotel_advisor_tools = [
    # e.g., get_hotel_recommendations could be added here,
    transfer_to_travel_advisor  # Handoff tool to call travel advisor if needed
]

# Create a hotel advisor agent using the prebuilt ReAct agent
hotel_advisor = create_react_agent(
    model,
    hotel_advisor_tools,
    state_modifier=(
        "You are a hotel expert that can provide hotel recommendations for a given destination. "
        "If you need help picking travel destinations, ask 'travel_advisor' for help."
        "You MUST include human-readable response before transferring to another agent."
    ),
)
```

**Explanation:**
- Similar to the travel advisor, this agent is built with its own set of tools and instructions tailored to hotel recommendations.

---

### 4. **Define Tasks to Call Agents**

We wrap agent calls into tasks using the `@task` decorator. This makes them callable units in our workflow.

#### **Task for Travel Advisor**

```python
@task
def call_travel_advisor(messages):
    # Invoke the travel advisor with the current conversation messages
    response = travel_advisor.invoke({"messages": messages})
    return response["messages"]
```

**Explanation:**
- **`@task`**: Marks the function as a task in our functional API.
- **`invoke`**: Calls the travel advisor agent with the current message history.
- **Return Value**: Extracts the "messages" field from the agent's response.

#### **Task for Hotel Advisor**

```python
@task
def call_hotel_advisor(messages):
    response = hotel_advisor.invoke({"messages": messages})
    return response["messages"]
```

**Explanation:**
- Similar to the travel advisor task, this task invokes the hotel advisor agent.

---

### 5. **Define the Multi-Agent Network Workflow**

The workflow is defined using the `@entrypoint()` decorator. This central function orchestrates which agent to call based on conversation history and tool calls.

```python
from langgraph_core.messages import AIMessage
from langgraph.graph import add_messages

@entrypoint()
def workflow(messages):
    # Initialize the conversation state with incoming messages
    messages = add_messages([], messages)

    # Start with the travel advisor as the active agent
    call_active_agent = call_travel_advisor
    while True:
        # Call the active agent and wait for the result
        agent_messages = call_active_agent(messages).result()
        # Append the agent's messages to the conversation history
        messages = add_messages(messages, agent_messages)
        
        # Identify the latest AI message from the agent's response
        ai_msg = next(m for m in reversed(agent_messages) if isinstance(m, AIMessage))
        
        # If there are no tool calls (handoff signals), end the loop
        if not ai_msg.tool_calls:
            break

        # Determine which transfer tool was called to switch agents
        tool_call = ai_msg.tool_calls[-1]
        if tool_call["name"] == "transfer_to_travel_advisor":
            call_active_agent = call_travel_advisor
        elif tool_call["name"] == "transfer_to_hotel_advisor":
            call_active_agent = call_hotel_advisor
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Expected transfer tool, got '{tool_call['name']}'")

    return messages
```

**Explanation:**
- **`@entrypoint()`**: Marks the function as the starting point of the workflow.
- **`add_messages`**: Utility to append new messages to the conversation history.
- **Loop:**  
  - Continuously calls the currently active agent (starting with travel advisor).
  - **`.result()`** waits for the agent's response.
  - **`ai_msg` Extraction:** Retrieves the most recent AI-generated message that may include tool calls.
  - **Handoff Logic:**  
    - If the AI message contains a tool call (e.g., `transfer_to_hotel_advisor`), the active agent is switched accordingly.
    - If no tool calls are present, the conversation loop ends.
- **Return:** The complete conversation history.

---

### 6. **Render Agent Outputs**

A helper function is defined to format and display the conversation messages.

```python
from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messages

def pretty_print_messages(update):
    if isinstance(update, tuple):
        ns, update = update
        if len(ns) == 0:
            return
        graph_id = ns[-1].split(":")[0]
        print(f"Update from subgraph {graph_id}:\n")
    
    for node_name, node_update in update.items():
        print(f"Update from node {node_name}:\n")
        for m in convert_to_messages(node_update["messages"]):
            m.pretty_print()
        print("\n")
```

**Explanation:**
- **`convert_to_messages`**: Converts raw message data to a human-readable format.
- **`pretty_print`**: Nicely formats each message for display.
- This function helps us visually inspect the output from our multi-agent workflow.

---

## 🧪 Testing the Workflow

Finally, we test our multi-agent network by simulating a conversation where the user asks for travel and hotel recommendations.

```python
for chunk in workflow.stream(
    [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "i wanna go somewhere warm in the caribbean. pick one destination and give me hotel recommendations",
        }
    ],
    subgraphs=True,
):
    pretty_print_messages(chunk)
```

**Explanation:**
- **`workflow.stream(...)`**: Streams the conversation through the multi-agent workflow.
- The input message starts the conversation.
- **`pretty_print_messages(chunk)`**: Displays the conversation updates, showing how the travel advisor picks a destination and then hands off control to the hotel advisor.

---
