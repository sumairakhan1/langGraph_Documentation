# 🔒 How to Update the Security Schema of Your OpenAPI Spec  

A well-structured **security schema** in an API is essential for defining how users should authenticate. This ensures secure access control and enables automatic client generation. In this guide, we’ll explore how to customize the **OpenAPI security schema** for **LangGraph Platform APIs** in a beginner-friendly way.  

> 🚀 **Real-World Use Case**:  
> Imagine you are building an API for an **e-commerce platform** that allows users to manage their orders. To ensure only authorized users can access their orders, you need a security schema. OpenAPI helps document this authentication process clearly, so developers can easily integrate with your API.

## 📌 **What is OpenAPI Security Schema?**  

The **OpenAPI security schema** defines how an API **authenticates users**. It specifies security mechanisms like:  
✅ API Keys  
✅ OAuth2  
✅ JWT Tokens  
✅ Basic Authentication  

This schema is documented in an API specification so that **developers know how to authenticate** when interacting with the API.

---

## ⚡ **Implementation vs Documentation**  

🔹 **Implementation**: Refers to writing the actual authentication logic (e.g., verifying API keys or OAuth tokens).  
🔹 **Documentation**: Describes how authentication works in **OpenAPI** to guide API consumers.  

This guide focuses **only on documentation**, not implementation. To implement authentication, refer to [How to Add Custom Authentication](#).

## 🌍 **Default Security Schema in LangGraph**  

The security schema depends on **how** you deploy LangGraph:  

### **🔹 LangGraph Cloud (Default Security)**  
👉 Uses a **LangSmith API key** in the `x-api-key` header.  

📌 **Example (YAML format in OpenAPI)**  
```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    apiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: x-api-key
security:
  - apiKeyAuth: []
```
🔹 If using **LangGraph SDK**, this API key is typically set via environment variables.  

---

### **🔹 Self-Hosted Deployments**  
👉 By default, **self-hosted** deployments **have no security schema** (no built-in authentication).  
👉 Must be **secured manually** (e.g., using OAuth2, JWT, or API keys).

## 🎨 **How to Customize the Security Schema in OpenAPI**  

To **customize authentication documentation**, add an **`openapi` field** in the `langgraph.json` file.  

📌 **Example: OAuth2 with Bearer Token**  
```json
{
  "auth": {
    "path": "./auth.py:my_auth",  
    "openapi": {
      "securitySchemes": {
        "OAuth2": {
          "type": "oauth2",
          "flows": {
            "implicit": {
              "authorizationUrl": "https://your-auth-server.com/oauth/authorize",
              "scopes": {
                "me": "Read information about the current user",
                "threads": "Access to create and manage threads"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "security": [
        {"OAuth2": ["me", "threads"]}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 🔑 **Breakdown of the Example**  
1. **`securitySchemes`**: Defines **OAuth2** as the authentication method.  
2. **`authorizationUrl`**: The authentication server’s endpoint for obtaining an OAuth token.  
3. **`scopes`**: Defines permissions (e.g., `me` for user info, `threads` for managing threads).  
4. **`security`**: Specifies **which authentication method** applies to the API.  

> 🔹 **Alternative**: Instead of OAuth2, you can use API keys, JWT, or Basic Auth.

## 🛠️ **Testing Your Updated Security Schema**  

After configuring your OpenAPI security schema, follow these steps to test it:  

✅ **Step 1**: Deploy your application.  
✅ **Step 2**: Open `/docs` in your API server (Swagger UI) to view the updated documentation.  
✅ **Step 3**: Try out API endpoints using credentials from your authentication server.  

> 🚀 **Pro Tip**: Ensure you've already implemented authentication logic before testing.

## 🏆 **Real-World Use Cases of OpenAPI Security Schema**  

🔹 **E-commerce Platforms**: Secure order management APIs with API keys or OAuth.  
🔹 **Banking APIs**: Use **OAuth2** for secure transactions.  
🔹 **Healthcare APIs**: Implement **JWT-based authentication** for patient data security.  
🔹 **AI & ML APIs**: Protect sensitive AI models with **API key-based access**.  

By properly documenting authentication with **OpenAPI**, developers can **seamlessly integrate** with your API while ensuring security. 🚀

## 🎯 **Final Thoughts**  

✅ OpenAPI **security schema** helps document API authentication clearly.  
✅ LangGraph **Cloud uses API keys**, while self-hosted requires manual setup.  
✅ **OAuth2, API keys, and JWT** are common authentication methods.  
✅ **Testing via Swagger UI** ensures correct implementation.
