# 🔐 Authentication & Access Control in LangGraph  

Authentication and access control are crucial for securing applications, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources. In this guide, we’ll go deep into **how to add custom authentication** in the LangGraph platform. We’ll break it down step by step so beginners can easily understand the concept, with real-world examples along the way.

## 📌 What is Authentication & Access Control?  
- **Authentication** verifies a user’s identity (e.g., logging in with a username and password).  
- **Access Control** determines what a user can do once authenticated (e.g., restricting access to certain resources).  

### **🛠 Real-World Example:**  
Think of an **airport security system**:  
1. **Authentication**: You show your passport and boarding pass to confirm your identity.  
2. **Access Control**: Only passengers with a valid ticket are allowed past security, and only certain passengers can enter VIP lounges.  

Similarly, in software, authentication confirms identity, and access control restricts what authenticated users can access.

## 🚀 How to Add Custom Authentication in LangGraph  

### **1️⃣ Prerequisites**  
Before implementing authentication, you should be familiar with:  
✔️ Authentication & Access Control concepts  
✔️ The **LangGraph Platform**  

🔹 **Python Only**: Currently, custom authentication is supported only in Python (`langgraph-api>=0.0.11`). JavaScript support is coming soon.  

🔹 **Supported Deployment Types**:  
✅ LangGraph Cloud  
✅ Enterprise self-hosted plans  
❌ Not supported for Lite self-hosted plans  

---

### **2️⃣ Implementing Authentication**  
Now, let's implement **custom authentication** in LangGraph using Python.  

📌 **Step 1: Create an Authentication Function**  

```python
from langgraph_sdk import Auth

my_auth = Auth()

@my_auth.authenticate
async def authenticate(authorization: str) -> str:
    token = authorization.split(" ", 1)[-1]  # Extract "Bearer <token>"
    try:
        # Verify token with your authentication provider
        user_id = await verify_token(token)
        return user_id  # Return the authenticated user ID
    except Exception:
        raise Auth.exceptions.HTTPException(
            status_code=401,
            detail="Invalid token"
        )
```

✅ **What’s Happening Here?**  
- The function extracts the token from the authorization header.  
- It verifies the token with an authentication provider (e.g., Firebase, AWS Cognito).  
- If valid, it returns the user ID.  
- If invalid, it raises a **401 Unauthorized** error.  

---

📌 **Step 2: Add Authorization Rules**  

Now that we have authentication, let's add access control rules to restrict access.  

```python
@my_auth.on
async def add_owner(
    ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext,
    value: dict,
):
    """Add owner to resource metadata and filter by owner."""
    filters = {"owner": ctx.user.identity}
    metadata = value.setdefault("metadata", {})
    metadata.update(filters)
    return filters
```

✅ **What’s Happening Here?**  
- It assigns ownership to resources based on the authenticated user.  
- It ensures users can only access their own data.  

---

📌 **Step 3: Enforce Access Control**  

```python
@my_auth.on.store()
async def authorize_store(ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext, value: dict):
    namespace: tuple = value["namespace"]
    assert namespace[0] == ctx.user.identity, "Not authorized"
```

✅ **What’s Happening Here?**  
- It checks if the user accessing the data is the owner.  
- If not, it raises a **Not authorized** error.  

🔹 **Example:**  
Imagine an **online banking app** where:  
- **User A** can view only **their** account transactions.  
- **User B** cannot see **User A’s** transactions.  

---

### **3️⃣ Update Configuration**  
Next, we need to tell **LangGraph** where to find the authentication rules.  

Modify your `langgraph.json` configuration file:  

```json
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./agent.py:graph"
  },
  "env": ".env",
  "auth": {
    "path": "./auth.py:my_auth"
  }
}
```

✅ **What’s Happening Here?**  
- This file specifies that the authentication logic (`my_auth`) is in `auth.py`.  
- It ensures that authentication is enforced when deploying the LangGraph application.  

---

### **4️⃣ Connecting from a Client**  
After setting up authentication, clients must send authorization tokens when making requests.  

📌 **Python Client Example**  

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

my_token = "your-token"  # Get this from your authentication provider
client = get_client(
    url="http://localhost:2024",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {my_token}"}
)
threads = await client.threads.search()
```

✅ **What’s Happening Here?**  
- The client sends a request with the **Bearer Token** in the `Authorization` header.  
- The server checks if the token is valid before allowing access.  

📌 **Other Methods**  
You can also authenticate via:  
✔️ Python RemoteGraph  
✔️ JavaScript Client  
✔️ JavaScript RemoteGraph  
✔️ CURL requests

## 🔥 Real-World Use Cases of Custom Authentication  
📌 **1️⃣ Banking Apps**  
- Only account owners can view transactions.  
- Admins can access all user accounts.  

📌 **2️⃣ E-commerce Platforms**  
- Customers can view their own orders.  
- Store managers can manage their inventory.  

📌 **3️⃣ Healthcare Systems**  
- Patients can access only their medical records.  
- Doctors can access patient records but not billing details.

## ✅ Summary  
🔹 **Authentication** verifies user identity.  
🔹 **Access control** determines what users can do.  
🔹 **LangGraph custom authentication** allows secure user access.  
🔹 **JWT tokens** are commonly used for authentication.  
🔹 **Client requests must include authorization tokens.**  

By implementing authentication and access control correctly, we can ensure that applications remain secure and only authorized users can access specific resources. 🚀💡
