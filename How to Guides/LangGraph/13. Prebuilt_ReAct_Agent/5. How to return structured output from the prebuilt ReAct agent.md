# How to Return Structured Output from the Prebuilt ReAct Agent

In this tutorial, we will explore how to return **structured output** from the prebuilt **ReAct agent**. The **ReAct agent** utilizes tools to call APIs or services and generates outputs. By providing a **response_format** parameter, you can control how the response is structured. We will go step-by-step through the process and understand how to implement it.

## What is Structured Output? 📝

Structured output refers to presenting the result of an operation or tool in a predefined format, which is easy for the program to process further. It is generally represented using structured data formats like **JSON** or **XML**. In this case, we use **Pydantic models** to define the schema of the output and ensure that the generated output matches the defined structure.

### Real-World Example 🌎

Let's say you're building a **weather service** where users can ask about the weather in various cities. The agent should not only provide the answer but also structure it in a way that the system can easily use in other parts of the application.

### How Does Structured Output Help? 🤔

- **Consistency**: Ensures the output format is always the same, making it easier to handle programmatically.
- **Clarity**: Helps when multiple agents or services need to consume the data.
- **Scalability**: Structured data can be easily extended with new fields.

## Setting Up the Environment ⚙️

To get started, we first need to set up the necessary environment and install required packages.

### 1. Install Required Packages 📦

We need to install the following libraries:
- `langgraph`: A library to work with LangGraph.
- `langchain-openai`: For integrating OpenAI's GPT models.
- `pydantic`: For defining structured data schemas.

```bash
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai pydantic
```

### 2. Set API Keys 🔑

You will need to set up your OpenAI API key to authenticate the usage of OpenAI's models.

```python
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

## Defining the Structured Output Format 🔧

We now define the output format that we want from the ReAct agent. We will use **Pydantic** models for this.

### 1. Define the Output Schema 🧑‍💻

The **WeatherResponse** class will define the format of the output. We are expecting weather information to be in the `conditions` field.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class WeatherResponse(BaseModel):
    """Respond to the user in this format."""
    conditions: str = Field(description="Weather conditions")
```

This will ensure that our response is always in this format, i.e., it will always contain the `conditions` field, and this field will describe the weather condition.

## Setting Up the ReAct Agent 🔄

The ReAct agent is the core of this process. It utilizes the model and the tools to gather information, and now we can customize it to produce structured output.

### 1. Initialize the Model 🚀

We first initialize the model (GPT-4 in this case) that will handle the natural language understanding and generate the weather conditions based on the user's question.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
```

### 2. Define the Tool 🔧

We will define a simple tool, `get_weather`, which can return weather information for specific cities (NYC and SF).

```python
from typing import Literal
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It's always sunny in sf"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown city")

tools = [get_weather]
```

### 3. Create the ReAct Agent with Structured Output 🧠

Now, we create the **ReAct agent** and specify the output format as **WeatherResponse**.

```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

graph = create_react_agent(
    model,
    tools=tools,
    response_format=WeatherResponse,
)
```

This step ensures that when the agent completes its task (i.e., gets the weather information), the result will follow the **WeatherResponse** schema, which contains the `conditions` field.

## Testing the Agent 🧪

Let's now test the agent with a sample input: asking about the weather in NYC.

```python
inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's the weather in NYC?")]}
response = graph.invoke(inputs)
```

The output will include a `structured_response` key, and the result will be structured according to the **WeatherResponse** format.

### 1. View the Structured Response 📊

```python
print(response["structured_response"])

# Output:
# WeatherResponse(conditions='cloudy')
```

This means that the agent has returned a structured response with the condition "cloudy" for NYC.

## Customizing the Output Format 🛠️

You might want to customize the output a little further. For example, let's make sure that the weather conditions are always capitalized.

### 1. Modify the Response Format to Capitalize Weather Conditions 🔡

To do this, we can pass both a **system prompt** and the output format.

```python
graph = create_react_agent(
    model,
    tools=tools,
    response_format=("Always return capitalized weather conditions", WeatherResponse),
)
```

### 2. Test the Custom Output Format ✨

Now when we ask about the weather, the agent will return the result with capitalized conditions.

```python
inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's the weather in NYC?")]}
response = graph.invoke(inputs)
print(response["structured_response"])

# Output:
# WeatherResponse(conditions='Cloudy')
```

## Summary 📚

By using the `response_format` parameter, we can ensure that the output of our ReAct agent is structured according to the schema we define. This helps in making the response predictable, consistent, and easy to work with in other parts of your system.

Key Points:
- **Structured Output**: It ensures that the response follows a specific schema, which is easy to handle.
- **Pydantic Models**: Used to define the structure of the response.
- **Customizable Output**: You can modify the system prompt or use other parameters to customize the output format.

This method can be applied to many scenarios, like **weather APIs**, **e-commerce systems**, and **question-answering systems** where structured responses are required to be processed downstream.
