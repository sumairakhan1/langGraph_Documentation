# 2. How to stream updates

# Streaming State Updates in Graphs 🚀

In today's world of distributed systems and machine learning, streaming updates of a graph's state can offer real-time insights into the execution of tasks. This is especially important when building interactive applications like chatbots or data-driven models that react to changes in real-time. Let's dive into how you can stream state updates of a graph in a simple and understandable way.

## **What is Streaming State Updates?** 🌊

When you're working with complex systems like graphs, often each node (a step or task in a process) can modify the overall state of the graph. Instead of waiting for the entire state to be updated and then receiving it at once, **streaming state updates** lets you receive only the changes or "updates" made by each node as they happen. This method is particularly useful when working with large graphs where you don't need to see the entire state every time—just the changes.

### **Streaming Mode: Updates vs Values**
- **`stream_mode="updates"`**: This mode only streams the changes made to the state. It's as if you're receiving small, incremental updates from the system.
- **`stream_mode="values"`**: In this mode, you receive the full state of the graph at each superstep (execution stage). This is like watching the entire movie instead of just the scenes that have changed.

## **Real-world Example 🏙️**

Think about a chatbot that provides weather updates. As the bot fetches data (e.g., current temperature, weather conditions), the system updates its state in stages:
1. The bot queries the weather API for the location.
2. It fetches the weather data (like temperature, wind speed).
3. It outputs the weather information to the user.

Each of these stages can be streamed as updates rather than sending the entire data all at once. This keeps the communication with the user smooth and real-time!

## **How to Stream State Updates of Your Graph 📈**

To stream state updates of your graph, you'll need to set up your client, initialize a thread, and then start streaming. Here's how to do that in Python.

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Client 🖥️**

First, initialize your client to connect to the graph system. This is where the graph will be deployed and run.

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)  # Your deployed graph URL
assistant_id = "agent"  # Name of your deployed graph
# Create a thread to start processing
thread = await client.threads.create()
print(thread)
```

In this step, the `thread` represents a unique instance or session where the graph execution happens.

### **Step 2: Start Streaming the Updates 📡**

Next, you can start streaming the updates from the graph. In this example, we are sending a user query about the weather and stream the updates that occur as the system processes the request.

```python
input = {
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "what's the weather in la"
        }
    ]
}
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input=input,
    stream_mode="updates",  # Here we choose the updates mode
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    print(chunk.data)
    print("\n\n")
```

### **Output Explanation 💬**

- **metadata**: This contains some basic information, like the `run_id` of the execution.
  
- **updates**: These are the actual updates happening during execution. For example, the bot is calling an API for weather data and then processing it.

- **end**: When the process is done, you'll receive an "end" event indicating the completion of the task.

### Example Output:
```
Receiving new event of type: metadata...
{"run_id": "cfc96c16-ed9a-44bd-b5bb-c30e3c0725f0"}

Receiving new event of type: updates...
{
  "agent": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "type": "ai",
        "tool_calls": [
          {
            "name": "tavily_search_results_json",
            "args": {
              "query": "weather in los angeles"
            },
            "id": "toolu_0148tMmDK51iLQfG1yaNwRHM"
          }
        ],
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
}

Receiving new event of type: updates...
{
  "action": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "content": [
          {
            "url": "https://www.weatherapi.com/",
            "content": "{\"location\": {\"name\": \"Los Angeles\", \"region\": \"California\", ...}}"
          }
        ],
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
}

Receiving new event of type: updates...
{
  "agent": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "content": "The weather in Los Angeles is currently overcast with a temperature of around 66°F (18.9°C).",
        "type": "ai",
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
}

Receiving new event of type: end...
None
```

## **Why Use Streaming? 🚅**

Streaming state updates provides several benefits:
- **Efficiency**: You only receive the changes, which reduces the amount of data being transferred.
- **Real-time feedback**: Perfect for scenarios that require immediate responses (like chatbots or monitoring systems).
- **Scalability**: It helps in handling large graphs efficiently by streaming only what’s necessary instead of the full state.

### **Example Use Case 🌍**

In **real-time weather forecasting**:
1. The system queries multiple APIs for weather updates.
2. It then updates the weather conditions incrementally.
3. The user receives a stream of updated information, such as changes in temperature, humidity, and wind speed, as the data becomes available.

This ensures that the user gets the most accurate, up-to-date information without waiting for the entire process to finish.

## **Summary 💡**

- **Streaming Updates** allows you to receive incremental changes in state as nodes execute.
- It’s more efficient than streaming the entire state, particularly for large or complex graphs.
- **Real-World Application**: Use it for real-time applications like chatbots, weather updates, or financial transactions.
- **Key Advantage**: Improves responsiveness and reduces data transfer by focusing on updates instead of the full state.

This technique is highly effective in systems that need to provide live feedback, like **customer support chatbots**, **real-time analytics dashboards**, or **interactive voice assistants**.
