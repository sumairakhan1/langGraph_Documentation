# 5. How to stream in debug mode


# How to Stream Debug Events 🔍

Streaming debug events allows you to monitor every internal step of your graph's execution in real-time. This is especially useful for developers who want to understand the behavior of their graph, diagnose issues, and optimize performance.

---

## What Are Debug Events? 🛠️

When you run your graph with `stream_mode="debug"`, you receive events that provide detailed information about each stage of execution. These events include:

- **Checkpoint Events**  
  - **What they are:**  
    Checkpoint events occur when the graph saves its state. This happens after every "super-step" (a complete round of processing).
  - **Why they matter:**  
    They allow you to see the exact state of your graph at key points, which is crucial for understanding how your data is evolving.
  
- **Task Events**  
  - **What they are:**  
    Task events are triggered before a super-step begins. They provide details about an individual task that is about to be executed.
  - **Why they matter:**  
    They help you see which specific task (or node) is starting its work and what input it’s handling.
  
- **Task Result Events**  
  - **What they are:**  
    Immediately after a task event, a task result event is emitted. This event contains the outcome or result of the task that just executed.
  - **Why they matter:**  
    They allow you to verify that each task produced the expected results, and they help pinpoint issues if something goes wrong.

## Setting Up the Environment ⚙️

Before streaming debug events, you need to set up your client and create a thread (a session) for your graph. Here’s an example in Python:

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

# Connect to your deployed LangGraph instance
client = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)
assistant_id = "agent"  # The graph or agent you are working with

# Create a new thread (a session for your execution)
thread = await client.threads.create()
print(thread)
```

**Sample Output:**

```json
{
    "thread_id": "d0cbe9ad-f11c-443a-9f6f-dca0ae5a0dd3",
    "created_at": "2024-06-21T22:10:27.696862+00:00",
    "status": "idle",
    "config": {},
    "values": null
}
```

This thread is where your graph execution will be tracked.

## Streaming Debug Events 🚀

Once your thread is ready, you can stream debug events. Here’s how to set up the streaming with `stream_mode="debug"`:

```python
input = {
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's the weather in SF?"
        }
    ]
}

# Stream debug events from the graph
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id=assistant_id,
    input=input,
    stream_mode="debug",
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    print(chunk.data)
    print("\n\n")
```

### Understanding the Debug Output

Your debug stream will produce a variety of events. Here’s what to look for:

- **Checkpoint Events**  
  - **Example:**
    ```json
    {
      "type": "checkpoint",
      "timestamp": "2024-08-28T23:16:28.134680+00:00",
      "step": -1,
      "payload": {
        "config": { ... },
        "values": { "messages": [], "search_results": [] },
        "metadata": { "source": "input", "writes": { "messages": [ ... ] }, "step": -1 },
        "next": ["__start__"],
        "tasks": [ { "id": "b40d2c90-dc1e-52db-82d6-08751b769c55", "name": "__start__", "interrupts": [] } ]
      }
    }
    ```
    - **Explanation:**  
      This checkpoint shows the state of the graph right after receiving the input, before any processing begins.

- **Task Events**  
  - **Example:**
    ```json
    {
      "type": "task",
      "timestamp": "2024-08-28T23:16:28.139928+00:00",
      "step": 1,
      "payload": {
        "id": "600a6ff3-7ff1-570a-b626-f887e9a70f1c",
        "name": "call_model",
        "input": { "messages": [ ... ], "search_results": [], "final_answer": null },
        "triggers": ["start:call_model"]
      }
    }
    ```
    - **Explanation:**  
      This task event indicates that the node (or task) `call_model` is about to start processing the input.

- **Task Result Events**  
  - **Example:**
    ```json
    {
      "type": "task_result",
      "timestamp": "2024-08-28T23:16:28.584833+00:00",
      "step": 1,
      "payload": {
        "id": "600a6ff3-7ff1-570a-b626-f887e9a70f1c",
        "name": "call_model",
        "error": null,
        "result": [
          ["messages", {
              "content": "Current weather in San Francisco",
              "type": "ai",
              ...
          }]
        ],
        "interrupts": []
      }
    }
    ```
    - **Explanation:**  
      This event shows the result of the `call_model` task. If an error occurred, it would be detailed here.

Debug events help you trace each super-step of your graph's execution—from input through each task and finally to the overall output. They are invaluable for understanding the internal workings and debugging issues.

## Real-World Example: Debugging a Chatbot Interaction 💬

Imagine you are building a customer support chatbot. The chatbot uses a graph to process user queries, fetch data, and generate responses.

### Scenario:

1. **User Query:**  
   A customer asks, "What's the weather in SF?"
   
2. **Graph Execution:**  
   - **Checkpoint:**  
     The graph saves the initial state with the user's input.
   - **Task:**  
     A task is triggered to call the weather API (`call_model`), processing the query.
   - **Task Result:**  
     The result of the weather API call is streamed back.
   - **Parallel Tasks:**  
     Later steps might involve parallel searches (e.g., getting additional info from different APIs).
   - **Final Checkpoint:**  
     After processing all tasks, the final state is saved.
   
3. **Debug Events:**  
   You can monitor each step:
   - When the graph saves its state (checkpoints),
   - When a task starts (task events),
   - And when a task completes (task result events).

**Benefits:**  
- **Quick Diagnosis:**  
  If the chatbot isn’t responding correctly, you can quickly pinpoint which task failed.
- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  Checkpoints can help you understand if the graph is processing tasks too slowly.
- **Improved User Experience:**  
  By resolving issues faster, you can ensure your customers receive prompt and accurate responses.

## Conclusion 🎯

Streaming debug events provides a detailed, step-by-step view of your graph's execution. By understanding checkpoint, task, and task_result events, you gain deep insights into your application's internal workings. This is especially valuable in complex systems like chatbots or data processing pipelines where real-time debugging and performance monitoring are crucial.

Whether you're diagnosing issues or optimizing performance, streaming debug events empowers you to see exactly what's happening under the hood. This capability is a game-changer for developers building interactive, high-performance applications.

Happy debugging! 🚀

# Understanding Debug Event Streaming in Graph Execution 🔄

Debugging is an essential part of programming, especially when you're working with complex systems like graphs or large-scale applications. When debugging a graph execution, one of the most useful tools is the ability to stream debug events, which provide detailed insights into the inner workings of the graph's execution.

In this guide, we will explore how to stream debug events in a graph, understand their different types, and walk through how this is done programmatically. Let’s break down the concept, step-by-step, in an easy-to-understand way with real-world applications.

## What Are Debug Events? 🛠️

Debug events are messages that provide insights into the execution of a graph (a system with nodes connected by edges). These events are streamed back to you as the graph runs, and they represent specific steps in the execution process.

The key debug event types that are streamed are:
1. **Checkpoint Events**: Mark when the graph saves its state.
2. **Task Events**: Represent the tasks to be executed during a super-step (an atomic execution unit in the graph).
3. **Task Result Events**: Show the results of the tasks after they’ve been executed.

### 1. **Checkpoint Events** 📌

A **checkpoint event** is a snapshot that shows the state of the graph after completing a certain step. It is recorded when the graph's state is saved, typically at the end of each super-step. These events give you a record of the graph's execution at specific points.

**Real-World Example**:  
Imagine you're running a complex machine learning pipeline, and at certain stages (or checkpoints), you want to save the model's weights or parameters to disk. This is like taking a "snapshot" of the model's state. If something goes wrong, you can go back to that saved state (checkpoint) and continue from there.

### 2. **Task Events** 📝

A **task event** occurs before each super-step, and it contains information about a single task that the graph is about to execute. In a graph, each task corresponds to a node, and each super-step might involve executing multiple tasks simultaneously or sequentially.

**Real-World Example**:  
In an e-commerce application, when a user makes a purchase, there are several tasks: validating the payment, updating the inventory, sending a confirmation email, etc. Each of these tasks happens as part of a larger flow (super-step), and you can stream events for each task to track what is happening.

### 3. **Task Result Events** ✅

Once a task has completed, a **task result event** is streamed back, containing the results of that task. These events provide feedback, such as whether the task succeeded or failed, and any outputs that resulted from the task.

**Real-World Example**:  
In the case of the e-commerce example mentioned earlier, after the payment validation task is completed, you’ll receive a task result event showing whether the payment was successful or not. Based on that result, the system might continue with the next task, such as sending an email.

## Setting Up to Stream Debug Events 🛠️

To begin streaming debug events, you need to set up a **client** and **thread** for interacting with the graph. This is done by making API calls using the appropriate SDK for your language (Python, JavaScript, etc.).

### Example in Python:

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client(url="<DEPLOYMENT_URL>")
assistant_id = "agent"

# Create a thread for streaming events
thread = await client.threads.create()
print(thread)
```

This code sets up a client to connect to the graph and creates a thread for interacting with it. Once the thread is created, you can use it to stream events.

---

## Streaming Debug Events 🔄

Now that we have set up the client and thread, we can start streaming debug events. Here’s how to do it:

### Example in Python:

```python
# Define the input to the graph (e.g., a user query)
input = {
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's the weather in SF?",
        }
    ]
}

# Stream debug events
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id=assistant_id,
    input=input,
    stream_mode="debug",
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    print(chunk.data)
    print("\n\n")
```

### How It Works:
- The `input` contains the messages or queries that are sent to the graph for processing.
- The `client.runs.stream` method streams events, and we print each event as it’s received.
- The event types we expect include `checkpoint`, `task`, and `task_result`.

## Example Event Stream Walkthrough 📊

Let’s break down an example event stream to understand how it works:

**Step 1: Checkpoint Event (Before the Graph Starts)**
```json
{
    'type': 'checkpoint',
    'timestamp': '2024-08-28T23:16:28.134680+00:00',
    'step': -1,
    'payload': { ... }
}
```
This marks the initial state before the graph starts executing.

**Step 2: Task Event (Execution Starts)**
```json
{
    'type': 'task',
    'timestamp': '2024-08-28T23:16:28.139928+00:00',
    'step': 1,
    'payload': {
        'id': 'task-id',
        'name': 'call_model',
        'input': { ... },
        'triggers': ['start:call_model']
    }
}
```
Here, a task named `call_model` starts. This task involves calling a model to process the input data.

**Step 3: Task Result Event (Task Completes)**
```json
{
    'type': 'task_result',
    'timestamp': '2024-08-28T23:16:28.584833+00:00',
    'step': 1,
    'payload': {
        'id': 'task-id',
        'name': 'call_model',
        'error': null,
        'result': [
            {
                'content': 'Current weather in San Francisco'
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
The `call_model` task is completed, and the result (`'Current weather in San Francisco'`) is returned.

**Step 4: Checkpoint Event (Graph State Saved)**
```json
{
    'type': 'checkpoint',
    'timestamp': '2024-08-28T23:16:28.584991+00:00',
    'step': 2,
    'payload': { ... }
}
```
After the task completes, the graph saves its state again.
