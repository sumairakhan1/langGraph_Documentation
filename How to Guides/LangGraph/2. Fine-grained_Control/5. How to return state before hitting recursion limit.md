# 5. How to return state before hitting recursion limit

# üåÄ How to Return State Before Hitting Recursion Limit  

When working with state-based workflows in **LangGraph**, you might encounter a situation where your graph runs indefinitely due to recursive loops. LangGraph sets a recursion limit to prevent infinite loops, but when the limit is reached, the program throws an error. This guide will teach you how to **return the last known state before reaching the recursion limit**, ensuring a graceful exit instead of a crash.

---

## üîç Why Is This Important?  

There are real-world scenarios where infinite loops or excessive recursion could cause failures. Some examples include:  

‚úîÔ∏è **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants** ‚Äì Avoiding infinite loops in AI decision-making.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Workflow Automation** ‚Äì Stopping workflows before exceeding allowed execution time.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Game AI Systems** ‚Äì Handling recursive decision trees efficiently.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Web Crawlers** ‚Äì Avoiding endless loops when scraping dynamic pages.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup  

Before we start coding, let's install the necessary package:

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph
```

This ensures we have **LangGraph** installed for creating state-based workflows.

# üö® **Understanding the Problem: Without Returning State**  

Let's first implement a **dummy recursive graph** that will always hit the recursion limit. We'll see what happens when we **don‚Äôt** handle the recursion error properly.

### üîπ **Code Explanation (Without Handling the Limit)**  

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# Defining our state
class State(TypedDict):
    value: str
    action_result: str

# Function to route execution
def router(state: State):
    if state["value"] == "end":  
        return END  # If "end" is encountered, stop execution
    else:
        return "action"  # Otherwise, continue looping

# Decision node (keeps looping)
def decision_node(state):
    return {"value": "keep going!"}

# Action node (performs an action and continues)
def action_node(state: State):
    return {"action_result": "what a great result!"}

# Building the state graph
workflow = StateGraph(State)
workflow.add_node("decision", decision_node)
workflow.add_node("action", action_node)
workflow.add_edge(START, "decision")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("decision", router, ["action", END])
workflow.add_edge("action", "decision")

# Compiling the workflow
app = workflow.compile()
```

### üìù **Breaking Down the Code**  

1. **`State` Class** ‚Äì Defines the structure of our state (contains `value` and `action_result`).  
2. **`router` Function** ‚Äì Decides the next step:
   - If `state["value"]` is `"end"`, stop execution.
   - Otherwise, continue the loop.  
3. **`decision_node` Function** ‚Äì Always sets the value to `"keep going!"`.  
4. **`action_node` Function** ‚Äì Just performs an action and continues looping.  
5. **Graph Setup** ‚Äì  
   - Defines nodes (`decision`, `action`).  
   - Adds transitions between nodes to create a **looping structure**.  

### ‚ùå **What Happens? (Recursion Error)**  

If we run the workflow:

```python
from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError

try:
    app.invoke({"value": "hi!"})
except GraphRecursionError:
    print("Recursion Error")
```

üî¥ **Output:**  

```
Recursion Error
```

Since the decision and action nodes always call each other, the loop never stops, causing a **GraphRecursionError**.

---

# ‚úÖ **Handling Recursion Limit Gracefully (Returning State)**  

Instead of letting our graph crash, we can **track the number of remaining steps** and **stop before hitting the recursion limit**.  

### üîπ **Code Explanation (With Handling the Limit)**  

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing import Annotated
from langgraph.managed.is_last_step import RemainingSteps

# Defining the state with a recursion tracker
class State(TypedDict):
    value: str
    action_result: str
    remaining_steps: RemainingSteps  # Tracks the remaining steps

# Function to route execution
def router(state: State):
    if state["remaining_steps"] <= 2:  
        return END  # Stop execution if only 2 steps are left
    if state["value"] == "end":
        return END  # Stop execution if value is "end"
    else:
        return "action"  # Otherwise, continue looping

# Decision node
def decision_node(state):
    return {"value": "keep going!"}

# Action node
def action_node(state: State):
    return {"action_result": "what a great result!"}

# Building the state graph
workflow = StateGraph(State)
workflow.add_node("decision", decision_node)
workflow.add_node("action", action_node)
workflow.add_edge(START, "decision")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("decision", router, ["action", END])
workflow.add_edge("action", "decision")

# Compiling the workflow
app = workflow.compile()

# Running the graph
app.invoke({"value": "hi!"})
```

---

### üìù **Breaking Down the Code**  

1. **`State` Class Update** ‚Äì We **added `remaining_steps`**, which helps track when we are near the recursion limit.  
2. **Updated `router` Function** ‚Äì  
   - If `remaining_steps` is **‚â§ 2**, the graph stops gracefully.  
   - Otherwise, it continues execution.  
3. **Graph Execution Flow** ‚Äì The loop **terminates safely** before hitting the limit.  

### ‚úÖ **Expected Output (No Recursion Error)**  

```
{'value': 'keep going!', 'action_result': 'what a great result!'}
```

Now, instead of crashing, the **graph gracefully exits** and returns the **last valid state**.

# üéØ **Real-World Use Cases of This Concept**  

üîµ **Chatbots & AI Assistants** ‚Äì Avoid getting stuck in repetitive AI decision-making.  
üîµ **Workflow Automation** ‚Äì Ensure an automated workflow doesn‚Äôt run indefinitely.  
üîµ **Web Scraping** ‚Äì Avoid infinite loops in recursive web crawlers.  
üîµ **Game AI** ‚Äì Prevent endless loops in decision-making trees.

# üöÄ **Key Takeaways**  

‚úÖ **Without a recursion limit handler**, the graph **crashes** when exceeding recursion depth.  
‚úÖ **By tracking `remaining_steps`**, we can **stop execution before hitting the limit**.  
‚úÖ This method **ensures a graceful exit** and **returns the last valid state**.  
‚úÖ Useful in **chatbots, automation workflows, web crawlers, and AI decision-making**.

# üöÄ How to Return State Before Hitting the Recursion Limit

When building complex workflows, it‚Äôs common to use recursive graph structures. However, if the graph runs too long, it may hit a recursion limit and throw an error. In some scenarios, you‚Äôd prefer to gracefully return the current state rather than crashing with an error. This guide shows you how to do exactly that!

---

## üìö Key Concepts

- **Recursion Limit:**  
  A safeguard that stops your graph from running indefinitely. When the limit is reached, the graph throws an error.

- **Returning State Gracefully:**  
  Instead of an error, you can return the **last valid state** just before the recursion limit is hit.

- **RemainingSteps Channel:**  
  A special state key (using the `RemainingSteps` annotation) that tracks how many more steps your graph can execute. When this value gets too low, you can decide to terminate the graph and return the current state.

---

## üîß Real-World Example

Imagine an **automated customer support chatbot** that iteratively asks clarifying questions. To avoid getting stuck in an endless loop of questions, you want to stop after a certain number of steps and return the current conversation state. This prevents the system from running indefinitely while still preserving useful data.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Without Returning State

In this first example, our graph is designed to loop indefinitely. When the recursion limit is hit, an error is thrown.

### Code Example

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# Define the state with two keys: value and action_result.
class State(TypedDict):
    value: str
    action_result: str

# Router function: Decides which node to go to next.
def router(state: State):
    # If the state value is "end", finish execution.
    if state["value"] == "end":
        return END
    else:
        # Otherwise, go to the "action" node.
        return "action"

# Decision node: Updates the state with a new value.
def decision_node(state):
    return {"value": "keep going!"}

# Action node: Performs an action and updates the state.
def action_node(state: State):
    # Imagine doing some processing here...
    return {"action_result": "what a great result!"}

# Build the graph.
workflow = StateGraph(State)
workflow.add_node("decision", decision_node)
workflow.add_node("action", action_node)
workflow.add_edge(START, "decision")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("decision", router, ["action", END])
workflow.add_edge("action", "decision")

# Compile the graph into an executable application.
app = workflow.compile()

# Visualize the graph (optional)
from IPython.display import Image, display
display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

# Invoke the graph. It will hit the recursion limit.
from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError
try:
    app.invoke({"value": "hi!"})
except GraphRecursionError:
    print("Recursion Error")
```

### Explanation

- **State Definition:**  
  ```python
  class State(TypedDict):
      value: str
      action_result: str
  ```  
  We define our state with two keys: `value` (a simple string) and `action_result` (result of some action).

- **Router Function:**  
  ```python
  def router(state: State):
      if state["value"] == "end":
          return END
      else:
          return "action"
  ```  
  - Checks if `value` is `"end"`.  
  - If not, it always routes to the `"action"` node.

- **Decision and Action Nodes:**  
  - **`decision_node`:** Always returns a state update with `"keep going!"`.  
  - **`action_node`:** Simulates doing some work and returns a new `action_result`.

- **Graph Building:**  
  The graph starts at `decision_node`, then conditionally goes to `action_node`, and then loops back to `decision_node`.

- **Recursion Error:**  
  When invoking `app.invoke({"value": "hi!"})`, the graph never terminates and eventually throws a `GraphRecursionError`.

## ‚úÖ Returning State Before Hitting the Recursion Limit

To gracefully exit before the recursion limit is hit, we add a new key to our state: **`remaining_steps`**. This key uses a special `RemainingSteps` annotation that tracks how many more steps the graph can execute.

### Code Example

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from typing import Annotated
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.managed.is_last_step import RemainingSteps

# Extend the state to include 'remaining_steps'
class State(TypedDict):
    value: str
    action_result: str
    remaining_steps: RemainingSteps  # Special channel to track steps

# Router function: Checks remaining steps to decide if the graph should terminate.
def router(state: State):
    # If remaining steps are 2 or less, finish the graph.
    if state["remaining_steps"] <= 2:
        return END
    # Also end if the state value is "end".
    if state["value"] == "end":
        return END
    else:
        # Otherwise, continue to the "action" node.
        return "action"

# Decision node: Updates the state.
def decision_node(state):
    return {"value": "keep going!"}

# Action node: Simulates an action and updates the state.
def action_node(state: State):
    # Perform your action here...
    return {"action_result": "what a great result!"}

# Build the graph with the new state including remaining_steps.
workflow = StateGraph(State)
workflow.add_node("decision", decision_node)
workflow.add_node("action", action_node)
workflow.add_edge(START, "decision")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("decision", router, ["action", END])
workflow.add_edge("action", "decision")

# Compile the graph.
app = workflow.compile()

# Invoke the graph. Instead of an error, it returns the state.
result = app.invoke({"value": "hi!", "remaining_steps": 100})
print(result)
```

### Explanation

- **Extended State:**  
  ```python
  class State(TypedDict):
      value: str
      action_result: str
      remaining_steps: RemainingSteps
  ```  
  - We add a new key, `remaining_steps`, which tracks how many steps remain before hitting the recursion limit.

- **Router Function Updated:**  
  ```python
  def router(state: State):
      if state["remaining_steps"] <= 2:
          return END
      if state["value"] == "end":
          return END
      else:
          return "action"
  ```  
  - **Check for `remaining_steps`:**  
    If `remaining_steps` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns `END` to terminate the graph gracefully.
  - This prevents the graph from entering an infinite loop.

- **Graph Execution:**  
  When invoking the graph with an initial state:
  ```python
  result = app.invoke({"value": "hi!", "remaining_steps": 100})
  ```  
  The graph will run until the `remaining_steps` count is nearly exhausted. Instead of throwing an error, it returns the last state before reaching the recursion limit.

---

## üí° Key Takeaways

- **Controlled Execution:**  
  Using a **`RemainingSteps`** channel lets you control the maximum number of steps the graph runs before gracefully terminating.

- **Graceful Termination:**  
  Instead of an error when the recursion limit is hit, you return the current state, ensuring that useful data is not lost.

- **Real-World Application:**  
  This technique is especially useful for long-running processes (like iterative decision-making systems) where you want to capture the last state before stopping.

- **Flexibility:**  
  It provides a way to build **robust workflows** that can handle infinite loops or deep recursions without crashing.
