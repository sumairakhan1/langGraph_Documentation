# 4. How to edit graph state

# üõ†Ô∏è How to Edit Graph State in LangGraph

In LangGraph, a **graph** represents a series of connected actions (or **nodes**) that process data. **Human-in-the-loop** (HIL) interactions allow a human to edit the state of this graph manually, enabling more dynamic and flexible processing. This is useful when we want to **interrupt** the execution of the graph, make changes, and then continue where we left off.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to **interrupt** the execution of the graph, update its state, and then resume it from the point of interruption. 

### üßë‚Äçüíª Real-World Example: Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
A real-world example of graph state editing would be in **chatbots** or **virtual assistants**. For instance, if a user asks for the weather in a city, the agent could interrupt the process to let the user choose a different city before continuing with the weather search.

### üöÄ Setting Up

To interact with LangGraph and edit the graph's state, we need to install some required packages and set up an API key for the **Anthropic LLM**.

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic
```

This installs **LangGraph** and **LangChain Anthropic** packages.

Next, we need to set up an API key for the **Anthropic LLM**. 

```python
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

The `_set_env` function will prompt us for the **API key** for the Anthropic API. If the key isn't already set in our environment, it will request it from the user.

---

### ‚ú® Simple Usage: Creating and Running the Graph

Now that we've set up everything, let's go through the steps of using LangGraph. We'll create a graph, interrupt it at a specific step, update the state, and then resume it.

#### Steps:

1. **Creating Nodes**: Each node in the graph represents an action (e.g., print statement, calculation).
2. **Interrupting Before a Node**: We'll set a breakpoint, so the graph stops before a specific node.
3. **Saving and Updating State**: We can update the state (data) of the graph at any time before continuing execution.

#### Code Walkthrough:

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from IPython.display import Image, display

# Define the structure of the state
class State(TypedDict):
    input: str

# Define the steps in the graph
def step_1(state):
    print("---Step 1---")
    pass

def step_2(state):
    print("---Step 2---")
    pass

def step_3(state):
    print("---Step 3---")
    pass

# Build the graph by adding nodes and edges
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)

# Set up memory to save the graph state
memory = MemorySaver()

# Compile the graph with a breakpoint before step_2
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["step_2"])

# View the graph's structure visually
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

#### Explanation of the Code:

1. **State Definition**: The `State` class represents the data structure that will be passed through the nodes of the graph.
    ```python
    class State(TypedDict):
        input: str
    ```
    - `State` stores a single value, `"input"`, which is a string (in this case, it can be a message or data).

2. **Node Functions**: These functions represent the actions that will take place in each step of the graph.
    ```python
    def step_1(state):
        print("---Step 1---")
        pass
    ```
    - Each node function (`step_1`, `step_2`, `step_3`) receives the `state` and performs an action (in this case, just printing a message).

3. **Building the Graph**: 
    ```python
    builder = StateGraph(State)
    builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
    builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
    builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
    builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
    builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
    builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
    builder.add_edge("step_3", END)
    ```
    - The `StateGraph` class is used to define the graph, and we add three nodes (`step_1`, `step_2`, `step_3`) with edges connecting them to show the sequence of actions.

4. **Memory Saver**: The `MemorySaver` class stores the graph‚Äôs state during execution, allowing us to modify it if needed.
    ```python
    memory = MemorySaver()
    ```
   
5. **Interrupting Before a Node**: We add an interrupt point before `step_2` using `interrupt_before`.
    ```python
    graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["step_2"])
    ```
    - The graph will execute until it reaches `step_2`, then pause. We can intervene at this point to update the state.

6. **Visualizing the Graph**: The graph‚Äôs structure can be displayed using `draw_mermaid_png()` to visualize the sequence of nodes.
    ```python
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
    ```

---

### üö¶ Running the Graph and Handling Interruptions

Now that we have set up our graph, we can run it and handle interruptions manually.

```python
# Input data
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}

# Thread for tracking
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption (before step_2)
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

#### Breakdown:

- **Input Data**: We define an initial input (`"hello world"`) that gets passed into the graph.
    ```python
    initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}
    ```
  
- **Thread**: The `thread` keeps track of the execution and ensures the graph state is managed across multiple runs.
    ```python
    thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
    ```
  
- **Graph Execution**: The `graph.stream()` method runs the graph, and it will pause at `step_2` as defined by the breakpoint.
    ```python
    for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
        print(event)
    ```
    - The graph will print the events, including the `"Step 1"` output, before it pauses at the breakpoint.

---

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Continuing the Graph After Interruption

Once the graph is interrupted at `step_2`, we can manually update the state and continue executing it. Here's how:

```python
# Manually update the state (you can modify this to change data or actions)
graph.update_state({"input": "updated input"})

# Continue the execution after interruption
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

#### Code Explanation:
- **update_state**: The `update_state` function allows us to modify the graph‚Äôs state during an interruption. In this case, we change the input to `"updated input"`.
    ```python
    graph.update_state({"input": "updated input"})
    ```

- **Resuming Execution**: The `graph.stream(None, thread)` continues the graph‚Äôs execution from where it left off, with the updated state.

---

### üí° Conclusion

Editing the graph state allows us to **dynamically adjust** the execution flow, making it highly useful in scenarios where a user needs to intervene in a process. Whether it‚Äôs modifying data or changing the path of execution, LangGraph provides a straightforward way to do so using breakpoints and manual updates.

This can be applied in:
- **Interactive data pipelines** where a human can correct or adjust the data at various points.
- **Virtual assistants or chatbots** that require user input to continue or adjust the flow.
- **Automated workflows** where human review is needed before continuing.

By controlling the graph‚Äôs state, we can create **adaptive systems** that respond to real-time feedback.

# üåê **How to Edit Graph State in LangGraph**

## üîë **Overview**
In this section, we'll explore how to edit the graph state manually during runtime. This concept allows humans to interact with an agentic system, adjusting the state of the graph before continuing its execution. This is particularly useful for debugging, testing, or correcting actions during the execution flow.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Concept in Action: Graph State Editing**

In LangGraph, a **graph state** represents the data and actions processed in a sequence of nodes (steps) that execute in a particular order. By **manually updating the state**, we can change the data in real-time to simulate different conditions or behaviors. A **human-in-the-loop (HIL)** interaction allows us to intervene at certain points to update the state as needed, which can be crucial in debugging or refining the behavior of an agent or system.

### **Real-World Example:**
Think of an automated customer support system where the agent (AI) asks for user details like "name" and "issue description." If the user provides incomplete data or wishes to update the response before proceeding, the system should allow manual edits to the state and then continue processing the corrected data.

---

## üìù **Example Code: Manually Updating the Graph State**

Here's a simple example of how to manually update the graph state in LangGraph.

### 1. **Setting Up the Graph**  
We first need to set up the graph, where we specify the sequence of steps (nodes).

```python
# Importing necessary classes and functions
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from IPython.display import Image, display

# Define the state type that will hold the input data
class State(TypedDict):
    input: str

# Define three simple steps for our graph
def step_1(state):
    print("---Step 1---")
    pass

def step_2(state):
    print("---Step 2---")
    pass

def step_3(state):
    print("---Step 3---")
    pass

# Create the StateGraph and add nodes
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)
```

### 2. **Setting Up Memory and Compiling the Graph**

```python
# Set up memory for saving the state
memory = MemorySaver()

# Add a breakpoint at "step_2", meaning the execution will stop before this step
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["step_2"])

# Visualize the graph
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

- **MemorySaver:** This component is used to save the graph's state as we move through its steps.
- **Interrupt Before Step:** We specify a breakpoint (`interrupt_before=["step_2"]`) to stop the execution before the second step, allowing manual intervention.

### 3. **Initial Graph Execution**

```python
# Provide the initial input and define the thread
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

# Start the graph execution
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

This will execute the graph up until `step_1`, print the results, and then pause before executing `step_2`.

---

## üõë **Manually Updating the State**

Now, let's manually update the graph's state and continue the execution. This is where the HIL interaction takes place.

```python
# Check the current state before the update
print("Current state!")
print(graph.get_state(thread).values)

# Update the state manually by modifying the input
graph.update_state(thread, {"input": "hello universe!"})

# Check the updated state
print("---\n---\nUpdated state!")
print(graph.get_state(thread).values)
```

### Explanation:
- **`get_state(thread)`**: This retrieves the current state of the graph for a particular thread (execution).
- **`update_state(thread, new_state)`**: This updates the state of the graph with new data (`"hello universe!"`).
- **State Change**: We replace the `"hello world"` input with `"hello universe!"`, which changes the behavior of the next steps in the graph.

### Output:

```
Current state!
{'input': 'hello world'}
---
---
Updated state!
{'input': 'hello universe!'}
```

---

## üöÄ **Continuing the Graph Execution**

After updating the state, we can resume the execution of the graph.

```python
# Continue the graph execution after the state update
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

This will continue from `step_2` and proceed through `step_3`, printing the output at each step.

---

## ü§ñ **Use Case: Building an Agent with Editable Graph State**

Now let's take a step further and apply this to an agent. In a ReAct-style agent, we may need to update the state after performing an action, such as making a tool call or invoking a model.

### 1. **Setting Up the Tool (e.g., Search Tool)**

```python
# Define a fake search tool (just for demo purposes)
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    return [
        "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini üòà."
    ]
```

### 2. **Define the Agent's Workflow**

We now define the agent's workflow, adding steps where the tool is called and the agent decides whether to continue or stop.

```python
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

# Define tool node
tool_node = ToolNode([search])

# Define the function to decide if the agent should continue
def should_continue(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"
    else:
        return "continue"

# Define the function to call the model
def call_model(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    # Simulate a model response (for demo)
    return {"messages": [f"Model responded to: {messages[-1]}"]}
```

### 3. **Setting Up the Graph and Conditional Logic**

```python
# Define the graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Add the nodes
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Add edges and conditional logic
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("agent", should_continue, {"continue": "action", "end": END})
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Set up memory and compile the graph
memory = MemorySaver()
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["action"])
```

### Explanation:
- **`call_model`**: This function invokes a model based on the current state.
- **`should_continue`**: It checks whether the agent should continue or stop based on the result of the tool's action.
- **Memory and State**: We set up memory to track the graph state and allow for interruptions before the `action` node.

---

## üîÑ **Summary**

- **Manual state updates** in LangGraph allow you to pause execution, modify the state, and then continue. This is particularly useful for debugging or changing behaviors in agentic systems.
- In **real-world applications**, this could be used in customer support systems or any environment where the AI system needs to adapt its actions based on human input.

By understanding and implementing this concept, you can build flexible, human-interactive systems that respond dynamically to changing conditions during execution.

# üß† **Interacting with the Agent: A Step-by-Step Guide**

In this section, we will explore how to interact with an **AI agent** and manage tool calls in a state-driven system. We will discuss the concepts behind **state management** and **tool calls**, and how to **update the agent's state** to reflect changes in the tool's parameters. This process is crucial for applications that require dynamic interactions, such as chatbots or personal assistants.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Concepts Involved**

### 1. **State Management** 
State management refers to how the current status or data of a system is stored and modified. For example, the current input in a conversation or the results of a previous tool call can be stored in the state and updated as needed. 

### 2. **Tool Calls**
Tool calls are actions triggered by the agent to perform specific tasks, such as querying a weather API, sending an email, or accessing a database. The agent can modify the parameters of a tool call dynamically during the interaction.

### 3. **Updating State**
When an agent interacts with tools, we often need to update the state to reflect changes, such as adjusting the parameters for a tool call or adding new information.

---

## üíª **Real-World Application Example**

Imagine you‚Äôre building a **virtual assistant** like **Siri** or **Google Assistant** that provides weather updates. The assistant can receive a request from the user to check the weather, but before sending the request to an external weather API, it might need to adjust the query, like changing ‚ÄúSan Francisco‚Äù to ‚ÄúSF‚Äù based on the user's preferences or a rephrased input.

---

### üåü **Code Example: Interacting with the Agent**

Let‚Äôs break down the code step-by-step to understand how to interact with the agent and dynamically update the state:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Step 1: Initialize the thread with a unique identifier
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}

# Step 2: Define the user's input message, asking for the weather in San Francisco
inputs = [HumanMessage(content="search for the weather in sf now")]

# Step 3: Stream the event (triggering the agent‚Äôs response)
for event in app.stream({"messages": inputs}, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

#### **Explanation:**

1. **`thread` Initialization**:  
   This defines the **thread ID** which represents a specific conversation or interaction. It ensures that the state for this specific conversation is correctly tracked and updated.
   
2. **`HumanMessage`**:  
   The `HumanMessage` is a message sent by the user. In this case, the user is asking the assistant to search for the weather in San Francisco.

3. **`app.stream`**:  
   This streams the events triggered by the user‚Äôs input. The agent processes the message and returns a response, which can include a tool call (in this case, searching the weather).

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Update the Tool Call Arguments**

Let‚Äôs say we want to modify the search query dynamically before the agent performs the tool call. Here‚Äôs how we can do it:

```python
# Step 1: Get the current state of the app
current_state = app.get_state(thread)

# Step 2: Retrieve the last message in the state (this message has the tool calls)
last_message = current_state.values["messages"][-1]

# Step 3: Update the query in the tool call
last_message.tool_calls[0]["args"] = {"query": "current weather in SF"}

# Step 4: Update the state with the modified message
app.update_state(thread, {"messages": last_message})
```

#### **Explanation:**

1. **`get_state(thread)`**:  
   This retrieves the current state of the thread. It includes the conversation history, tool calls, and any other information relevant to the interaction.

2. **Modifying the Tool Call**:  
   We access the last message in the state, which contains the tool call (searching the weather). We then modify the `args` of the tool call to change the query parameter.

3. **`update_state`**:  
   After modifying the tool call‚Äôs arguments, we update the state with the new message. This ensures that the agent uses the updated parameters for the tool call when it continues the interaction.

---

### üîÑ **Stream and Continue the Interaction**

Now that the state has been updated, we can continue the interaction by streaming the event again:

```python
# Step 1: Stream the events again to continue the process
for event in app.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

#### **Explanation:**

- The `stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values")` call allows the agent to continue processing. It uses the updated state, including the modified tool call.
- The agent will now execute the updated search query ("current weather in SF") and provide the results.

---

### üß© **Real-World Scenario**

Consider a **customer support chatbot** that needs to handle different tool calls depending on user requests. For instance, the chatbot could:

- **Search for product information** using a product database.
- **Generate invoices** using an invoicing tool.
- **Check stock levels** through an API.

By updating the state and modifying tool parameters based on user inputs, the chatbot can dynamically change its behavior, providing customized results without needing to reset or restart the conversation.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Handling Multiple Tool Calls**

The agent can handle multiple tool calls within an interaction. Here‚Äôs how you can structure this:

```python
# Step 1: Define a function to check whether the tool should continue
def should_continue(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    
    # Check if the last message has tool calls
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"  # End the interaction
    else:
        return "continue"  # Continue to the next tool call

# Step 2: Define a function that calls the model and processes the messages
def call_model(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": [response]}  # Return the model's response

# Step 3: Add logic to the graph to continue processing
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("agent", should_continue, {"continue": "action", "end": END})
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")
```

#### **Explanation:**

- **`should_continue`**: This function checks if the last message contains tool calls. If not, it ends the interaction. Otherwise, it continues to the next step (calling the tool or agent).
- **`call_model`**: This function processes the messages and interacts with the AI model to generate a response.
- **Conditional Edges**: The graph is set up to either continue with the next action or end based on the state of the interaction.

---

## üéØ **Conclusion**

In this tutorial, we learned how to interact with an AI agent, update the state dynamically, and modify tool call parameters. This kind of interaction is powerful for building **intelligent systems** like chatbots, virtual assistants, and other AI-driven tools that require real-time updates and decision-making.

By following these steps, you can create applications that respond intelligently to user inputs, adjust their behavior based on real-time data, and perform complex tasks using external tools and APIs.
