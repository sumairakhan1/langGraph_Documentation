# 3. How to add breakpoints

# Breakpoints in LangGraph ‚è∏Ô∏è

Breakpoints are a powerful feature in LangGraph that allow an agentic system to pause execution at a specific step, wait for human approval (or additional input), and then resume from the saved state. This is especially useful in sensitive operations or where a human needs to validate the next step before it proceeds.

In this guide, we'll explain how to add breakpoints using LangGraph, with detailed code examples and explanations for beginners.

---

## üìö What Are Breakpoints?

**Breakpoints** let you "pause" the graph execution at a designated step. When the execution is paused, you can review the state or request approval from a human before proceeding further.  
**How It Works:**
- **Checkpoints:**  
  LangGraph saves the graph‚Äôs state after each node execution using checkpoints.
- **Interrupt Before:**  
  The parameter `interrupt_before` tells the graph where to pause execution.  
- **Resuming Execution:**  
  After human approval (or any decision), the graph resumes execution from the last saved checkpoint.

**Real-World Example:**  
Imagine a banking application where before executing a fund transfer, a supervisor must approve the transaction. The system pauses (at a breakpoint) before executing the transfer, waits for approval, and then resumes to complete the transfer.

## üîß Setting Up the Environment

Before adding breakpoints, ensure you have installed the required packages and set your API keys for Anthropic (or your LLM of choice):

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic
```

Set your API keys:

```python
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

---

## üíª Code Example: Adding a Breakpoint

In this example, we create a simple graph with three steps. We want to insert a breakpoint before executing **Step 3** so that we can wait for human approval.

### Full Code Example

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from IPython.display import Image, display

# Define the state schema
class State(TypedDict):
    input: str

# Define three steps for the graph
def step_1(state):
    print("---Step 1---")
    pass  # Placeholder for additional logic

def step_2(state):
    print("---Step 2---")
    pass  # Placeholder for additional logic

def step_3(state):
    print("---Step 3---")
    pass  # Placeholder for additional logic

# Create a new graph with our defined state
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)  # Node for Step 1
builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)  # Node for Step 2
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)  # Node for Step 3

# Define the flow of the graph using edges
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)

# Set up a memory checkpointer to save state after each node execution
memory = MemorySaver()

# Compile the graph with an interrupt (breakpoint) before Step 3
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["step_3"])

# Display the graph as a diagram (optional)
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

## üîç Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Importing Modules and Defining State:**
   ```python
   from typing_extensions import TypedDict
   from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
   from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
   from IPython.display import Image, display
   ```
   - **Purpose:**  
     Import necessary modules from LangGraph and utilities for displaying the graph diagram.
   - **TypedDict:**  
     Used to define the structure of our state.

2. **Defining the State:**
   ```python
   class State(TypedDict):
       input: str
   ```
   - **Purpose:**  
     This defines our state schema with a single field `input` of type `str`.  
     You can extend this as needed.

3. **Defining the Graph Steps:**
   ```python
   def step_1(state):
       print("---Step 1---")
       pass
   def step_2(state):
       print("---Step 2---")
       pass
   def step_3(state):
       print("---Step 3---")
       pass
   ```
   - **Purpose:**  
     Each function represents a step in our graph. For now, they only print which step is being executed.  
     The `pass` statement is a placeholder where you can add additional logic.

4. **Building the Graph:**
   ```python
   builder = StateGraph(State)
   builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
   builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
   builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
   ```
   - **Purpose:**  
     We initialize the graph with our state and add our nodes (steps).

5. **Defining the Flow (Edges):**
   ```python
   builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
   builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
   builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
   builder.add_edge("step_3", END)
   ```
   - **Purpose:**  
     These lines set up the execution order of our nodes.
     - Start ‚Üí Step 1 ‚Üí Step 2 ‚Üí Step 3 ‚Üí End

6. **Setting Up Memory Checkpoints:**
   ```python
   memory = MemorySaver()
   ```
   - **Purpose:**  
     `MemorySaver` is used to store the state of the graph after each node execution, allowing you to resume from the last checkpoint.

7. **Compiling the Graph with a Breakpoint:**
   ```python
   graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["step_3"])
   ```
   - **Purpose:**  
     The graph is compiled into a runnable object.  
     `interrupt_before=["step_3"]` sets a breakpoint before executing Step 3. This means the graph will pause and wait for human approval before moving to Step 3.

8. **Displaying the Graph:**
   ```python
   display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
   ```
   - **Purpose:**  
     This displays a visual diagram of the graph structure, making it easier to understand the flow.

## üîÑ Running the Graph with Breakpoints

Once the graph is compiled with a breakpoint, you can execute it until it pauses, review the state, and then resume execution based on human approval.

### Execution Example

```python
# Input: Set the initial state for the graph.
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}

# Thread: Create a configuration with a unique thread ID.
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

# Run the graph until it reaches the breakpoint (before Step 3)
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

# Request human approval to continue
try:
    user_approval = input("Do you want to go to Step 3? (yes/no): ")
except:
    user_approval = "yes"

if user_approval.lower() == "yes":
    # If approved, resume execution from the breakpoint
    for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
        print(event)
else:
    print("Operation cancelled by user.")
```

### Detailed Explanation

- **Initial Input:**  
  The graph is initialized with the state `{"input": "hello world"}`.
- **Thread Configuration:**  
  A unique thread ID (`"1"`) is assigned to this execution to manage the state.
- **Graph Execution Until Breakpoint:**  
  The graph runs through **Step 1** and **Step 2**.  
  When it reaches the breakpoint set before **Step 3**, it pauses.
- **Human Approval:**  
  The user is prompted to approve if they want to proceed to **Step 3**.
- **Resuming Execution:**  
  If the user approves (by typing "yes"), the graph resumes from the checkpoint and executes **Step 3**.

**Sample Console Output:**

```
{'input': 'hello world'}
---Step 1---
---Step 2---
Do you want to go to Step 3? (yes/no): yes
---Step 3---
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Breakpoints:**  
  Allow the graph to pause at specific nodes, waiting for human input or approval.
- **Checkpoints:**  
  The state is saved after each node execution, enabling the graph to resume from the last checkpoint.
- **Usage:**  
  Particularly useful in high-stakes applications like financial transactions or healthcare, where critical decisions require human oversight.
- **Implementation:**  
  With LangGraph, you define breakpoints using `interrupt_before` during graph compilation and then resume execution based on user input.

This approach enhances the reliability of agentic systems by integrating human-in-the-loop interactions, ensuring that sensitive actions are carefully reviewed before proceeding.

# Adding Breakpoints in LangGraph for Human-in-the-Loop Interaction üöÄ

In agentic systems, **Human-in-the-loop (HIL)** interactions are crucial for ensuring decisions are made with human approval, especially when sensitive actions are involved. One common way to facilitate this is through **breakpoints**, which allow the system to pause and wait for human input before proceeding. This pattern is often used in complex workflows where human intervention is required before continuing.

### What is a Breakpoint? üõë

A **breakpoint** in programming is a point in the code where the execution of the program is intentionally paused, allowing developers (or systems) to inspect the state of the system and decide whether to continue. In the context of LangGraph, a breakpoint halts the flow of the graph at specific steps and requests human approval before continuing.

Think of it as a **stop-sign** in a flow, where the system pauses to ask if the human wants to proceed.

### How Breakpoints Work in LangGraph üí°

LangGraph is a framework for building workflows with nodes and edges, allowing you to manage complex logic easily. **Breakpoints** are built on top of LangGraph **checkpoints**, which save the graph's state after each node executes. This state is preserved in a thread and can be accessed later to resume execution.

The idea is to stop the graph at a specific point (e.g., before performing a sensitive action) and wait for the user's approval before proceeding.

### Real-world Example üåé

Imagine you're building an **approval workflow for a financial transaction system**. Before completing a large money transfer, the system pauses and asks for user confirmation. This allows users to review the details and confirm if they want to proceed. This is an example of a **Human-in-the-loop** interaction using breakpoints.

---

## Setting Up Breakpoints: Step-by-Step Guide ‚öôÔ∏è

Let's break this down into simple steps. We'll walk through the code that sets up and handles breakpoints in LangGraph.

### Step 1: Installing Required Packages üíª

First, we need to install the necessary packages to run LangGraph and LangChain. These packages help us work with LangGraph and integrate the approval system.

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic
```

This command installs the **LangGraph** and **LangChain** libraries, which are needed to handle the graph and breakpoints.

### Step 2: Setting up API Keys üîë

Next, we need to set up the **Anthropic API** key for the LLM (Large Language Model) used in LangGraph.

```python
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

In this block:
- We use `getpass` to securely input the **API key** for Anthropic.
- The `_set_env()` function ensures that the API key is set in the environment variables if it's not already set.

### Step 3: Creating the Graph and Adding Breakpoints üßë‚Äçüíª

We now create a **state graph** with specific steps and define where to add the breakpoints.

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from IPython.display import Image, display

class State(TypedDict):
    input: str

def step_1(state):
    print("---Step 1---")
    pass

def step_2(state):
    print("---Step 2---")
    pass

def step_3(state):
    print("---Step 3---")
    pass

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)
```

### Code Explanation:
1. **StateGraph** is the main component where you define the steps.
2. Each `step_x` function represents an action or task within that node of the graph (e.g., printing a message).
3. We add these steps to the graph using `add_node()` and define the sequence using `add_edge()`.

### Step 4: Setting up Memory and Checkpointing üìö

```python
memory = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["step_3"])
```

In this part:
- We create a **memory saver** that will store the state of the graph at each point.
- The `interrupt_before=["step_3"]` argument specifies that the graph will pause before executing step 3, asking for approval.

### Step 5: Viewing the Graph üñºÔ∏è

```python
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

This line renders and displays the graph in a **Mermaid** diagram format, showing the flow and breakpoints visually.

### Step 6: Running the Graph and Handling Human Approval üë•

```python
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

try:
    user_approval = input("Do you want to go to Step 3? (yes/no): ")
except:
    user_approval = "yes"

if user_approval.lower() == "yes":
    for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
        print(event)
else:
    print("Operation cancelled by user.")
```

### Code Explanation:
1. **Initial Input**: We pass an initial input to start the graph.
2. **Graph Execution**: The graph starts executing and prints out each step until it hits the breakpoint (before Step 3).
3. **Human Approval**: The system asks for the user‚Äôs approval before continuing to Step 3.
4. **Conditional Execution**: Based on the user's response, the graph either continues or halts.

### Sample Output:
```bash
---Step 1---
---Step 2---
Do you want to go to Step 3? (yes/no): yes
---Step 3---
```

If the user types `yes`, the graph proceeds to **Step 3**. If the user types `no`, the process is canceled.

---

## Real-World Use Case: Approval Workflow in Financial Systems üíµ

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a system where high-value transactions require **human approval** before proceeding. Using breakpoints, the system can pause at the point of approval and only proceed once the human confirms they want to continue. This prevents mistakes and ensures sensitive transactions are thoroughly checked.

---

## Key Takeaways üìö
- **Breakpoints** allow for pausing the system at critical points and waiting for human input before proceeding.
- LangGraph provides an easy way to set up breakpoints in workflows.
- Human-in-the-loop interactions are ideal for situations like **financial transactions**, where human approval is needed before an action is taken.

By using LangGraph‚Äôs breakpoints, you can ensure that complex systems behave safely and responsibly, especially when sensitive decisions are involved.

# üöÄ Understanding Breakpoints in Agents

Breakpoints are essential in human-in-the-loop (HIL) systems, where we pause the execution of a process at certain points to allow human input before continuing. This is useful in scenarios where sensitive actions require human approval, such as financial transactions or automated decision-making. In this guide, we'll explore how to use breakpoints in agents, where we can manually approve certain actions before proceeding.

## üîë What is an Agent in LangGraph?

An **agent** in LangGraph is a system that makes decisions, typically using large language models (LLMs) or other decision-making mechanisms. The agent interacts with external tools, processes, or actions and can make autonomous decisions based on the current state.

In the context of breakpoints, we introduce a manual intervention before the agent takes specific actions. This is especially useful for tools that perform actions like web searches, API calls, or other potentially risky operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Example

Let's break down the setup and code required to add a breakpoint before an agent performs an action.

### 1. **Install Required Packages**

First, install the necessary packages using `pip` to ensure we have all the required libraries.

```bash
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic
```

### 2. **Import Required Libraries**

We will use `LangChain` for the LLM model, `LangGraph` for the agent logic, and `ToolNode` for tool interaction.

```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, START
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
```

### 3. **Create a Tool (Example: Web Search)**

We define a tool, which could be anything from web searches to performing calculations. In this case, we'll create a mock search function.

```python
@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though üòä
    return [
        "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini üòà."
    ]
```

### 4. **Set Up the Model**

We create a model using `ChatAnthropic` that will interact with the tools.

```python
tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Set up the model with tools
model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
model = model.bind_tools(tools)
```

### 5. **Define the Workflow and Nodes**

The workflow consists of nodes that represent actions the agent will take. We'll define two nodes:
- `agent`: This node invokes the model.
- `action`: This node calls the search tool.

```python
# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"  # Finish if no tools are called
    else:
        return "continue"  # Continue if tools are called

# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": [response]}

# Create a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
```

### 6. **Set Up Conditional Edges**

Conditional edges determine which node to transition to based on the results of a function. Here, we check if the agent should continue or finish based on whether a tool was called.

```python
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent", should_continue, {"continue": "action", "end": END}
)
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")
```

### 7. **Add a Breakpoint**

Now, to add the breakpoint, we use `interrupt_before`. This ensures that the execution pauses right before the `action` node is called, allowing the user to approve or deny the action.

```python
# Set up memory for checkpointing
memory = MemorySaver()

# Compile the workflow with the breakpoint before "action"
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["action"])
```

### 8. **Run the Graph and Handle User Approval**

Finally, we run the graph, allowing the user to manually approve or reject the action.

```python
# Example of running the graph and waiting for user approval
initial_input = {"messages": []}
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for event in app.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

try:
    user_approval = input("Do you want to go to Step 3? (yes/no): ")
except:
    user_approval = "yes"

if user_approval.lower() == "yes":
    for event in app.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
        print(event)
else:
    print("Operation cancelled by user.")
```

### 9. **Graph Visualization**

This step visualizes the graph, so you can see the structure of your workflow.

```python
display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

## üåç Real-World Example: Approval in Financial Transactions

In real-world applications, breakpoints can be used in systems that require approval before executing sensitive actions. A typical example is in online banking or payment systems, where:
1. **Transaction Request:** A user requests a fund transfer or payment.
2. **Breakpoint:** Before processing the payment, the system pauses and asks the user to approve the transaction (e.g., "Do you want to transfer $100 to this account?").
3. **Approval/Rejection:** The system waits for the user's input before continuing with the transaction.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Breakdown

### Code Explanation:
1. **Tool Setup:**
   The `search` function mimics a tool (like an API call). We use the `@tool` decorator to mark it as a callable tool within the agent's workflow.
   
2. **Model Setup:**
   The model (`ChatAnthropic`) is bound to the `search` tool, which means the model can call this tool during its execution.

3. **State Management:**
   The `MessagesState` keeps track of the messages exchanged between the agent and the tools. We use this state to manage the workflow and determine the next step.

4. **Adding Breakpoints:**
   The `interrupt_before` parameter is used to introduce a breakpoint, pausing execution before the tool (`action`) is called.

5. **User Interaction:**
   The code pauses at the breakpoint, waits for user input (approval), and then continues based on the user's response.

---

## üß† Key Takeaways:
- **Breakpoints** help control when an agent should pause for manual intervention.
- **Conditional Edges** allow the agent to decide the next action based on certain conditions (e.g., if a tool is called).
- **Real-world Application:** Use in scenarios requiring approval, like financial transactions or automated decisions.

# Interacting with the Agent üß†

In this section, we'll walk through how to interact with an agent built using LangChain and understand the process in detail. The agent's behavior can be controlled using breakpoints, allowing us to pause the execution at certain points, inspect what the agent is doing, and then continue.

## What is an Agent and Why Use It? ü§ñ

An **agent** is a system that can autonomously perform tasks by interacting with external tools or services. In our case, the agent is designed to use a search tool to gather information, like checking the weather. 

**Breakpoints** are points where the execution of the agent can be paused. This allows you to manually inspect or approve the next steps in the agent's workflow. For example, we may pause the execution before a tool is used, and then decide whether or not to allow it to proceed.

### Example Use Case in Real Life üåç
Imagine you have an AI assistant that helps with your daily tasks. For example, it could manage your calendar, send emails, or even check the weather. If the assistant wants to check the weather using a third-party tool (e.g., a weather API), you might want to approve the request before it proceeds. This is where breakpoints are useful‚Äîthey give you control over what the agent does.

## Code Breakdown üìù

### Setting Up the Agent and Tool

We start by creating the agent and the tool it will use.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, START
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

# Define a tool to perform a search
@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # Placeholder for actual search functionality
    return [
        "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini üòà."
    ]

# Define tools and create a tool node
tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Set up the model
model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
model = model.bind_tools(tools)
```

**Explanation**:
- We define a tool `search` that simulates a web search. The actual search logic isn't implemented here; it's just a placeholder that returns a mock response about the weather in San Francisco.
- We bind this tool to the agent model (`ChatAnthropic`) to enable the agent to use the tool when needed.
  
### Defining the Workflow and Breakpoints

Next, we set up the agent's workflow. The workflow describes the sequence of steps (nodes) the agent will follow. We also introduce a **breakpoint** to interrupt the workflow before calling the tool.

```python
# Define a function to decide if the agent should continue
def should_continue(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"  # Finish if no tool call
    else:
        return "continue"  # Continue to the next node

# Define a function that invokes the model
def call_model(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": [response]}  # Return the model's response

# Create the agent's workflow
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Add nodes for the agent and action (tool)
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the starting point of the workflow
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# Add a conditional edge that decides the next step
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent",
    should_continue,
    {
        "continue": "action",  # If we continue, move to the action node
        "end": END,  # Otherwise, finish the workflow
    },
)

# After the tool is used, go back to the agent
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")
```

**Explanation**:
- We define the `should_continue` function, which checks whether the agent has called a tool. If not, the workflow ends; if a tool was called, the agent moves on to the next node.
- The `call_model` function invokes the model, gets its response, and returns it.
- We define the workflow with the nodes "agent" and "action". The agent first invokes the model, and then based on whether a tool is needed, it either moves to the action node (to call the tool) or finishes the workflow.

### Interrupting the Workflow with a Breakpoint

We introduce a breakpoint that stops the execution before the action node is called. This is useful for manually approving actions.

```python
# Set up memory and compile the workflow with a breakpoint before the action node
memory = MemorySaver()
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["action"])
```

**Explanation**:
- `MemorySaver` saves the state of the agent during execution.
- `interrupt_before=["action"]` ensures the agent pauses before calling the action node (where the tool is invoked). This allows us to inspect the agent's actions before it proceeds.

### Interacting with the Agent üßë‚Äçüíª

Now that we have set up the agent, we can interact with it by sending a message. The agent will stop at the breakpoint, and we can inspect the state.

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Simulate a conversation with the agent
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
inputs = [HumanMessage(content="search for the weather in sf now")]

# Stream the agent's response, pausing before calling the tool
for event in app.stream({"messages": inputs}, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()  # Print the last message in the event
```

**Explanation**:
- We create a human message asking the agent to search for the weather in San Francisco.
- `app.stream` starts the conversation, but the agent pauses before using the `search` tool due to the breakpoint.

### Continuing the Workflow

After inspecting the state, we continue the workflow by calling the agent again, this time without any new inputs. The agent will run the tool and provide the results.

```python
# Continue the workflow and run the tool
for event in app.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()  # Print the last message after tool use
```

**Explanation**:
- The second call to `app.stream(None)` proceeds as if the interruption didn't occur. The tool (`search`) is now invoked, and the agent returns the result, which is printed as the output.

## Real-World Example: Virtual Assistant üì±

Imagine a **virtual assistant** like Siri or Alexa, where you ask for information (like the weather). When the assistant needs to use a third-party service (e.g., a weather API), it can pause before making the request. This gives you an opportunity to approve or modify the request, adding a layer of control to the agent's behavior. For instance:
- **You ask:** "What's the weather like today?"
- **Agent pauses** before calling the weather service.
- **You approve** and the agent continues, showing the weather details.

## Summary

By using breakpoints in the agent workflow, we gain control over when and how the agent interacts with external tools. This approach is especially useful for ensuring that the agent's actions are appropriate and approved before proceeding.
