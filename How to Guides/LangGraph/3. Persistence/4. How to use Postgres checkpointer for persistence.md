# 🗄️ How to Use Postgres Checkpointer for Persistence in LangGraph

## 📌 Introduction  
When building AI agents with **LangGraph**, you may want them to **persist state** so they can remember past interactions. This guide explains how to use **PostgreSQL** as a **checkpointer** for state persistence using the `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` library.

A checkpointer allows:
✅ **Saving the state** of an agent across multiple interactions.  
✅ **Restoring previous states** even if the program restarts.  
✅ **Efficient execution** by avoiding unnecessary recalculations.

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases  
1. **Chatbots with Memory:** Agents that remember past conversations.  
2. **Workflow Automation:** Storing progress in long-running processes.  
3. **AI Assistants:** Remembering previous user preferences.

## ⚙️ **Setting Up Postgres for LangGraph Checkpointing**  

### 🔹 Step 1: Install Dependencies  
To use PostgreSQL for LangGraph checkpointing, install the required libraries:  

```bash
pip install -U psycopg psycopg-pool langgraph langgraph-checkpoint-postgres
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Set Environment Variables  
You need to set environment variables like your API keys.

```python
import os
import getpass

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```
**Explanation:**  
🔹 Checks if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is already set; if not, it prompts the user to enter it securely.  
🔹 `getpass.getpass()` ensures the key is not visible when entered.  

---

## 🛠️ **Defining the Model and Tools**  
We define a simple function to get weather data and integrate it with an AI model.

```python
from typing import Literal
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.aio import AsyncPostgresSaver

@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It might be cloudy in NYC"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It's always sunny in SF"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown city")

tools = [get_weather]
model = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
```

**Explanation:**  
🔹 Defines a tool (`get_weather()`) that returns weather data for NYC or SF.  
🔹 Uses **LangChain's** `ChatOpenAI` model to process queries.  
🔹 `create_react_agent()` will later be used to build the agent.

---

## 🗃️ **Connecting to PostgreSQL for Checkpointing**  

### 🔹 **Database Connection URI**  
Define the PostgreSQL database connection details:

```python
DB_URI = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5442/postgres?sslmode=disable"

connection_kwargs = {
    "autocommit": True,
    "prepare_threshold": 0,
}
```

**Explanation:**  
🔹 `DB_URI` contains credentials (`postgres:postgres`) and the host (`localhost:5442`).  
🔹 `autocommit=True` ensures changes are saved immediately.  

---

## 🔄 **Setting Up Checkpointing Methods**  

### 🟢 **Using a Connection Pool (Recommended)**
```python
from psycopg_pool import ConnectionPool

with ConnectionPool(conninfo=DB_URI, max_size=20, kwargs=connection_kwargs) as pool:
    checkpointer = PostgresSaver(pool)
    checkpointer.setup()  # Initialize database

    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
    res = graph.invoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in SF")]}, config)

    checkpoint = checkpointer.get(config)
```

**Why Use a Connection Pool?**  
✅ **Improves Performance:** Maintains multiple reusable connections.  
✅ **Reduces Overhead:** Avoids creating a new connection for each query.  
✅ **Ideal for Frequent Requests.**  

---

### 🔵 **Using a Single Connection**
```python
from psycopg import Connection

with Connection.connect(DB_URI, **connection_kwargs) as conn:
    checkpointer = PostgresSaver(conn)
    checkpointer.setup()

    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}
    res = graph.invoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in SF")]}, config)

    checkpoint_tuple = checkpointer.get_tuple(config)
```

**When to Use?**  
✅ Best for **long-running** database operations.  
✅ Simple to set up but **not scalable** for high loads.  

---

### 🟠 **Using a Connection String**
```python
with PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI) as checkpointer:
    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
    res = graph.invoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in SF")]}, config)

    checkpoint_tuples = list(checkpointer.list(config))
```
**When to Use?**  
✅ If database credentials are passed as a single string.  
✅ Simplifies database connections for quick setup.  

---

## ⚡ **Asynchronous Checkpointing for Better Performance**  

### 🟢 **Using an Async Connection Pool**
```python
from psycopg_pool import AsyncConnectionPool

async with AsyncConnectionPool(conninfo=DB_URI, max_size=20, kwargs=connection_kwargs) as pool:
    checkpointer = AsyncPostgresSaver(pool)
    await checkpointer.setup()

    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "4"}}
    res = await graph.ainvoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in NYC")]}, config)

    checkpoint = await checkpointer.aget(config)
```
**Why Use Async?**  
✅ **Non-blocking operations:** Other tasks can execute while waiting for DB response.  
✅ **Ideal for high-concurrency applications.**  

---

### 🔵 **Using an Async Single Connection**
```python
from psycopg import AsyncConnection

async with await AsyncConnection.connect(DB_URI, **connection_kwargs) as conn:
    checkpointer = AsyncPostgresSaver(conn)
    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "5"}}
    res = await graph.ainvoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in NYC")]}, config)
    
    checkpoint_tuple = await checkpointer.aget_tuple(config)
```
✅ Best for **long transactions** but not scalable.  

---

### 🟠 **Using an Async Connection String**
```python
async with AsyncPostgresSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI) as checkpointer:
    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "6"}}
    res = await graph.ainvoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in NYC")]}, config)

    checkpoint_tuples = [c async for c in checkpointer.alist(config)]
```
✅ Quick setup using a **single string-based connection.**  

---

## 🎯 **Conclusion**  
Using **PostgreSQL Checkpointer in LangGraph** allows AI agents to **persist state** efficiently.  
💡 Choose **Sync/Async** methods based on your use case:  
✅ **For high performance:** Use **Async with Connection Pool.**  
✅ **For simple applications:** Use **Sync with Single Connection.**  
✅ **For quick setup:** Use **Connection String.**

# 🚀 Using Postgres Checkpointer for Persistence in LangGraph

In this guide, we'll learn how to use a **Postgres checkpointer** to persist your LangGraph agent's state. This allows your agent to remember previous interactions, even across different sessions, making it ideal for long-running or stateful AI applications.

Imagine a real-world scenario where you build an AI-powered customer service chatbot. With persistence, the chatbot can recall previous conversations, customer preferences, or past orders from a Postgres database, ensuring a smooth, personalized experience.

---

## 🔧 Overview and Real-World Use Case

- **What is Persistence?**  
  Persistence allows an AI agent to save its state (i.e., conversation history or computed data) so that subsequent interactions can build upon earlier ones.  
  
- **Real-World Example:**  
  A chatbot that helps customers order products. It remembers customer details (e.g., their favorite items) even if they return after a break, using a shared Postgres database.

- **Why Use Postgres?**  
  Postgres is a robust relational database. By using the `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` library, you can save and retrieve your agent's state efficiently.

---

## 📦 Setup: Installing Required Packages and API Keys

Before we begin, install the necessary packages and set up your API keys. Use the code snippet below:

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U psycopg psycopg-pool langgraph langgraph-checkpoint-postgres

import getpass
import os

# Helper function to set environment variables securely
def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

# Set your OpenAI API key (required for LangGraph agents using OpenAI models)
_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Package Installation:**  
  - `psycopg` and `psycopg-pool` are used for PostgreSQL connections and connection pooling.  
  - `langgraph` and `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` are the core libraries for building LangGraph agents with Postgres persistence.
  
- **API Key Setup:**  
  - The `_set_env` function prompts for the `OPENAI_API_KEY` if it's not already set.  
  - This key is required for authenticating your calls to OpenAI's API.

---

## 📜 Defining the Model and Tools

We'll create a simple agent that uses a React-based agent with a tool for getting weather information. This is for demonstration purposes.

```python
from typing import Literal
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.aio import AsyncPostgresSaver

# Define a simple tool that provides weather information.
@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It's always sunny in sf"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown city")

# List of tools available to the agent.
tools = [get_weather]

# Initialize the chat model.
model = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Tool Definition:**  
  - The `get_weather` function is decorated with `@tool` so that it can be called by the agent.  
  - It provides a simple weather lookup for `"nyc"` and `"sf"`.

- **Model Initialization:**  
  - We initialize the `ChatOpenAI` model with specific parameters (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini` and `temperature=0` for deterministic responses).

- **Agent Creation:**  
  - Later, we will create the agent with `create_react_agent`, passing in our model, tools, and a Postgres checkpointer.

## 🔗 Connecting to Postgres for Persistence

There are several ways to connect to Postgres. We'll explore both synchronous and asynchronous approaches.

### 1. Synchronous Connection Using a Connection Pool

A connection pool reuses connections, which is efficient for applications with frequent, short-lived database operations.

```python
from psycopg_pool import ConnectionPool

# Define your Postgres connection URI and connection parameters.
DB_URI = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5442/postgres?sslmode=disable"
connection_kwargs = {
    "autocommit": True,
    "prepare_threshold": 0,
}

# Use a connection pool to manage database connections.
with ConnectionPool(
    conninfo=DB_URI,
    max_size=20,
    kwargs=connection_kwargs,
) as pool:
    # Create a PostgresSaver checkpointer using the connection pool.
    checkpointer = PostgresSaver(pool)

    # Initialize the checkpointer; this sets up the necessary tables.
    checkpointer.setup()

    # Create the React-based agent with the checkpointer for persistence.
    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    
    # Set a configuration with a unique thread_id.
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
    
    # Invoke the agent with a sample message.
    res = graph.invoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in sf")]}, config)
    
    # Retrieve the stored checkpoint for inspection.
    checkpoint = checkpointer.get(config)
```

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

- **ConnectionPool Setup:**
  - `DB_URI` holds the connection string for your Postgres instance.
  - `connection_kwargs` are extra parameters such as `autocommit`.
  - `ConnectionPool` is instantiated with a maximum of 20 connections.

- **Creating the Checkpointer:**
  - `PostgresSaver(pool)` creates a checkpointer that uses the pool.
  - `checkpointer.setup()` initializes the database (only needed once).

- **Creating and Invoking the Agent:**
  - `create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)` creates the agent.
  - The `config` dictionary includes a unique `thread_id` for this interaction.
  - `graph.invoke(...)` sends a message to the agent and processes the response.
  - `checkpointer.get(config)` retrieves the checkpoint state for review.

---

### 2. Synchronous Connection Using a Single Dedicated Connection

This approach is simpler and suitable for longer transactions.

```python
from psycopg import Connection

with Connection.connect(DB_URI, **connection_kwargs) as conn:
    # Create the checkpointer using the dedicated connection.
    checkpointer = PostgresSaver(conn)
    
    # Initialize the agent with persistence.
    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}
    
    # Invoke the agent.
    res = graph.invoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in sf")]}, config)
    
    # Retrieve the checkpoint as a tuple.
    checkpoint_tuple = checkpointer.get_tuple(config)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Connection:**  
  - `Connection.connect(DB_URI, **connection_kwargs)` creates a single dedicated connection to Postgres.
  
- **Checkpointer and Agent:**  
  - A `PostgresSaver` is created with this connection.
  - The agent is then built and invoked similarly to the connection pool method.
  - `get_tuple(config)` retrieves the checkpoint state as a tuple for further inspection.

---

### 3. Synchronous Connection Using a Connection String

This method encapsulates the connection details and simplifies the setup.

```python
with PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI) as checkpointer:
    # Create the agent using the connection string based checkpointer.
    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
    
    # Invoke the agent.
    res = graph.invoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in sf")]}, config)
    
    # List all checkpoint tuples for the given configuration.
    checkpoint_tuples = list(checkpointer.list(config))
```

**Explanation:**

- **from_conn_string:**  
  - `PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI)` creates a checkpointer directly from a connection string.
  
- **Agent Invocation:**  
  - The agent is created and invoked similarly, and checkpoints are listed using `list(checkpointer.list(config))`.

---

### 4. Asynchronous Connections

Asynchronous connections are non-blocking, which is useful in high-concurrency applications. We'll cover both connection pool and single connection examples.

#### 4.1 Using an Asynchronous Connection Pool

```python
from psycopg_pool import AsyncConnectionPool
import asyncio

async def async_pool_example():
    async with AsyncConnectionPool(
        conninfo=DB_URI,
        max_size=20,
        kwargs=connection_kwargs,
    ) as pool:
        # Create an asynchronous checkpointer using the connection pool.
        checkpointer = AsyncPostgresSaver(pool)
        
        # Initialize the checkpointer asynchronously.
        await checkpointer.setup()
        
        # Create the agent with persistence.
        graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
        config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "4"}}
        
        # Asynchronously invoke the agent.
        res = await graph.ainvoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in nyc")]}, config)
        
        # Retrieve the checkpoint asynchronously.
        checkpoint = await checkpointer.aget(config)

# Run the asynchronous example.
asyncio.run(async_pool_example())
```

**Explanation:**

- **AsyncConnectionPool:**  
  - Manages a pool of asynchronous connections.
  
- **AsyncPostgresSaver:**  
  - Provides asynchronous methods (`setup`, `aget`, etc.) for persistence.
  
- **Graph Invocation:**  
  - The agent is invoked using `graph.ainvoke` (asynchronous invocation), and the checkpoint is retrieved with `await checkpointer.aget(config)`.

#### 4.2 Using an Asynchronous Dedicated Connection

```python
from psycopg import AsyncConnection
import asyncio

async def async_conn_example():
    async with await AsyncConnection.connect(DB_URI, **connection_kwargs) as conn:
        # Create an async checkpointer using the dedicated connection.
        checkpointer = AsyncPostgresSaver(conn)
        
        # Create the agent.
        graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
        config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "5"}}
        
        # Asynchronously invoke the agent.
        res = await graph.ainvoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in nyc")]}, config)
        
        # Retrieve the checkpoint as a tuple asynchronously.
        checkpoint_tuple = await checkpointer.aget_tuple(config)

# Run the asynchronous connection example.
asyncio.run(async_conn_example())
```

**Explanation:**

- **AsyncConnection.connect:**  
  - Establishes a dedicated asynchronous connection.
  
- **Checkpointer and Agent:**  
  - The asynchronous checkpointer is created and passed to the agent.
  - The agent is invoked asynchronously, and checkpoints are retrieved with `aget_tuple`.

#### 4.3 Using an Asynchronous Connection String

```python
async def async_conn_string_example():
    async with AsyncPostgresSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI) as checkpointer:
        # Create the agent using the connection string-based async checkpointer.
        graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
        config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "6"}}
        
        # Asynchronously invoke the agent.
        res = await graph.ainvoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in nyc")]}, config)
        
        # Asynchronously list all checkpoint tuples.
        checkpoint_tuples = [c async for c in checkpointer.alist(config)]

# Run the async connection string example.
asyncio.run(async_conn_string_example())
```

**Explanation:**

- **from_conn_string:**  
  - Similar to the synchronous version but for async operations.
  
- **Agent Invocation and Checkpoint Listing:**  
  - The agent is invoked asynchronously, and checkpoint tuples are iterated asynchronously with an async comprehension.
