# 🗑️ How to Delete Messages in a Stateful AI Assistant  

In AI assistants or chatbots, messages are stored as a **state** (a collection of data that persists). Usually, new messages are added to this state, but sometimes, you may need to **remove certain messages**—for example:

✅ To comply with privacy policies  
✅ To clean up conversation history  
✅ To remove outdated or incorrect information  

In this guide, we’ll explore **how to delete messages using the `RemoveMessage` modifier in LangGraph** and understand **when and why** you might need this.

## 🏗️ **Understanding Message States in AI Assistants**  

Before deleting messages, let's first understand **how messages are stored** in AI chatbots.

### 📌 **What is a Message State?**  
A **message state** is a data structure that holds **past user messages and AI responses**. This is important because:

- **Context Awareness**: The AI remembers past messages to provide meaningful responses.
- **Conversation Flow**: Previous messages determine how the AI responds to new ones.
- **Customization**: Developers can modify or delete specific messages when needed.

In **LangGraph**, messages are stored using `MessagesState`, which allows us to **add, modify, or remove messages** efficiently.

## 🛠️ **Setting Up the Environment**  

Before we start coding, ensure you have the required libraries installed.

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic
```

### 🔑 **Setting Up API Keys**
We’ll use **Anthropic’s Claude model** for processing chat messages. To authenticate, set your API key:

```python
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

✅ **Why do we need this?**  
This ensures that our chatbot can **communicate with the Claude API** securely.

## 🤖 **Building the AI Chat Assistant (Before Deleting Messages)**  

Let’s create a **basic AI chatbot** using LangGraph. This chatbot will:

1️⃣ Accept user messages  
2️⃣ Process them using Claude AI  
3️⃣ Generate responses  

### **🔹 Importing Required Libraries**
```python
from typing import Literal

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
```

### **🔹 Setting Up Memory**
We use `MemorySaver()` to **store past messages**.

```python
memory = MemorySaver()
```

### **🔹 Creating a Simple AI Tool**
We'll define a **search tool** that mimics web browsing.

```python
@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    return "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini 😈."
```

### **🔹 Defining AI Model**
```python
tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)
model = ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
bound_model = model.bind_tools(tools)
```
This binds **Claude-3-Haiku** to our chatbot.

### **🔹 Creating the AI Agent Workflow**
```python
def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    return END if not last_message.tool_calls else "action"

def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": response}
```
✅ **What’s Happening Here?**  
- `should_continue()` checks if the AI should **continue or stop**.  
- `call_model()` processes the user's message using **Claude AI**.

### **🔹 Defining Chat Flow**
```python
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("agent", should_continue, ["action", END])
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```
✅ **Why Do We Need This?**  
This defines how **messages flow** in the chatbot.

## 🗑️ **Manually Deleting Messages**  

Now, let's **delete messages** from the stored state.

### **📝 Step 1: Checking Current Messages**
Before deletion, let's see the messages stored.

```python
messages = app.get_state(config).values["messages"]
messages
```
This will output something like:

```
[HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm Bob"),
 AIMessage(content="Nice to meet you, Bob!"),
 HumanMessage(content="what's my name?"),
 AIMessage(content="You said your name is Bob.")]
```

---

### **📝 Step 2: Deleting a Specific Message**  

To **delete a message**, use `RemoveMessage`:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage

app.update_state(config, {"messages": RemoveMessage(id=messages[0].id)})
```
✅ **What’s Happening Here?**  
- `RemoveMessage(id=messages[0].id)` **targets the first message** (Bob’s introduction).  
- `update_state()` **removes the selected message** from memory.

### **📝 Step 3: Verifying Deletion**  
Now, check if the message is deleted:

```python
messages = app.get_state(config).values["messages"]
messages
```
🔎 **Expected Output (After Deletion)**:
```
[AIMessage(content="Nice to meet you, Bob!"),
 HumanMessage(content="what's my name?"),
 AIMessage(content="You said your name is Bob.")]
```
✅ **The first user message is gone!**

## 🌍 **Real-World Use Cases for Message Deletion**  

📌 **Privacy Compliance (GDPR & CCPA)**  
- If a user requests data deletion, you can remove specific messages.

📌 **Customer Support Chatbots**  
- Deleting unnecessary messages helps keep the conversation relevant.

📌 **AI Assistants (Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa)**  
- Removing old commands ensures **only the latest data is used**.

📌 **AI-Powered Educational Tutors**  
- If a student makes a mistake, you can **delete incorrect messages** before storing them.
