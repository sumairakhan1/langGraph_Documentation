**3. How to create cron jobs**

# Cron Jobs ‚è∞

In many scenarios, you might need to schedule tasks or actions that should happen at specific times, without needing to manually trigger them. This is where **Cron Jobs** come into play! They help automate tasks, like sending reports, updating data, or sending reminders, all without human intervention.

In **LangGraph Cloud**, you can use **Cron Jobs** to run tasks automatically at scheduled times using a cron expression, which is a format used to specify time intervals. You don't need to write custom scripts to handle these tasks‚ÄîLangGraph Cloud takes care of it with the **Crons client**.

### What are Cron Jobs? ü§î

A **Cron Job** is a job that runs automatically at specific times, based on a schedule defined by a cron expression. This is ideal when you want to perform repetitive tasks like sending daily emails, cleaning up data, or generating reports. 

For example, imagine you want to send a weekly to-do email to your team without needing to manually trigger it every week. Using Cron Jobs, you can set up this task to run automatically at the scheduled time.

### Setting Up Cron Jobs in LangGraph Cloud üîß

Before scheduling a Cron Job, you'll need to set up a few things: your SDK client, assistant, and thread. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)

# Using the graph deployed with the name "agent"
assistant_id = "agent"

# Create thread
thread = await client.threads.create()
print(thread)
```

This creates a thread where tasks can be scheduled and executed later.

##### Output:

```json
{
    'thread_id': '9dde5490-2b67-47c8-aa14-4bfec88af217', 
    'created_at': '2024-08-30T23:07:38.242730+00:00', 
    'updated_at': '2024-08-30T23:07:38.242730+00:00', 
    'metadata': {}, 
    'status': 'idle', 
    'config': {}, 
    'values': None
}
```

### Scheduling a Cron Job üóìÔ∏è

Once you‚Äôve set up the client and thread, you can schedule your task to run at a specific time using a **cron expression**. A cron expression is a string with five fields that represent the time schedule, such as minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week. For example, the cron expression `"27 15 * * *"` means "run at 3:27 PM every day."

```python
# This schedules a job to run at 15:27 (3:27 PM) every day
cron_job = await client.crons.create_for_thread(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    schedule="27 15 * * *",
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What time is it?"}]},
)
```

This creates a **Cron Job** that triggers a specific task (in this case, asking "What time is it?") at the specified time every day.

### Deleting Cron Jobs üóëÔ∏è

Once a Cron Job is no longer needed, you should delete it to prevent unnecessary charges. Cron Jobs that are not deleted can keep running, leading to unexpected costs.

To delete a Cron Job:

```python
await client.crons.delete(cron_job["cron_id"])
```

### Stateless Cron Jobs üõë

Stateless Cron Jobs work similarly to regular ones, but they don't require any thread context. This is useful when you need to execute tasks without associating them with a specific thread.

For example:

```python
# This schedules a stateless job to run at 15:27 (3:27 PM) every day
cron_job_stateless = await client.crons.create(
    assistant_id,
    schedule="27 15 * * *",
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What time is it?"}]},
)

# To delete the stateless cron job:
await client.crons.delete(cron_job_stateless["cron_id"])
```

### Real-World Use Case: Automating Reports üìä

Imagine you work in a project management team, and you need to send weekly status reports to your boss. Instead of manually preparing and sending the reports, you can automate this process using a Cron Job. 

- **Cron Expression Example**: `"0 9 * * 1"` means **"run every Monday at 9 AM"**.
- **Task**: Prepare a report and send it to the boss without needing human intervention.

This automation is especially useful for repetitive tasks like:
- Sending daily updates.
- Backing up databases.
- Sending reminders for upcoming meetings or deadlines.
- Running regular health checks on your website or system.

### Key Takeaways üìù

- **Automate Tasks**: Use Cron Jobs to schedule repetitive tasks without needing manual intervention.
- **Use Cron Expressions**: These strings define the timing of when your jobs should run (e.g., every day at 3:27 PM).
- **Delete When Done**: Always clean up your jobs after they are no longer needed to avoid unnecessary API charges.
- **Stateless Jobs**: Stateless Cron Jobs allow for tasks to run independently of threads.

### Conclusion üéØ

Cron Jobs are a powerful tool for automating tasks in LangGraph Cloud. By using cron expressions, you can schedule repetitive actions, save time, and ensure that tasks are completed on time. Whether it‚Äôs sending daily emails, cleaning up databases, or generating reports, Cron Jobs simplify the process and improve efficiency in your workflows.
