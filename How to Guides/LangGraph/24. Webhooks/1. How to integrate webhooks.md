# üöÄ Understanding Webhooks and How to Use Them

In this guide, we will explore the concept of **webhooks**, explaining them in a beginner-friendly way, showing how to implement them, and discussing their real-world applications. We will use a **client-server** interaction model to demonstrate how webhooks can be employed to handle events in real-time.

### üìö What are Webhooks?

A **webhook** is a way for an app or server to send data to another system when a specific event occurs. Think of a webhook like a **phone call** that tells another system, "Hey, something important just happened!" Instead of constantly asking (polling) the system if something changed, webhooks **push** the information to you as soon as it happens.

For example, consider a payment system:
- When a user makes a payment, the payment provider (like PayPal) can notify your system immediately with a **POST request** (a webhook).
- Your system doesn't need to keep checking PayPal to know when a payment happened.

In the **LangGraph Cloud** context, you can use webhooks to get notifications when a task completes. Once an API call finishes, it sends the result to a specific URL (your **webhook**), which your server can then process.

### üõ†Ô∏è How Do Webhooks Work in LangGraph?

LangGraph allows you to use webhooks for different API endpoints, like when creating or streaming tasks. When you initiate an action (for example, requesting some data), LangGraph can trigger a webhook to notify your system when the action is complete.

#### **Example Endpoints Accepting Webhook**:
- **Create Run**: Start a new task.
- **Stream Run**: Continuously stream data until completion.
- **Wait Run**: Wait for the task to finish.
- **Create Cron**: Schedule tasks at specific times.

### üíª Example of Using a Webhook

Let‚Äôs go through the process of setting up a webhook for **streaming a run**.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup: Create a Thread and Initialize the Client

First, you‚Äôll need to create a **thread** using LangGraph's SDK. A thread is like a container that holds your tasks.

Here‚Äôs how you set it up:

```python
# Importing the SDK for LangGraph
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

# Initialize the client with the deployment URL
client = get_client(url="<DEPLOYMENT_URL>")

# Specify the assistant ID
assistant_id = "agent"

# Create a new thread for your task
thread = await client.threads.create()

# Print the thread details to confirm it's created
print(thread)
```

- **Explanation**:  
  - `get_client(url="<DEPLOYMENT_URL>")`: Initializes the connection to LangGraph Cloud with your deployment URL.
  - `client.threads.create()`: Creates a new thread where you‚Äôll store your tasks.
  - `print(thread)`: This will print the thread‚Äôs ID and other information confirming that the thread was created successfully.

#### Example Output:
```json
{
    'thread_id': '9dde5490-2b67-47c8-aa14-4bfec88af217', 
    'created_at': '2024-08-30T23:07:38.242730+00:00',
    'status': 'idle', 
    'config': {},
    'values': None
}
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Invoking a Run with a Webhook

Next, we‚Äôll initiate a **run** with a webhook. This means that once the run completes, LangGraph will send the result to your webhook endpoint.

Here‚Äôs how you do it:

```python
# Prepare the input data (messages that will be sent to the assistant)
input = { "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello!" }] }

# Start the run with a stream and specify the webhook URL
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread["thread_id"],  # The thread ID we created earlier
    assistant_id=assistant_id,      # The assistant we're using
    input=input,                    # The input data to send
    stream_mode="events",           # Stream data as events
    webhook="https://my-server.app/my-webhook-endpoint"  # Webhook URL
):
    # Process the streamed output here (in this case, we're just passing)
    pass
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `client.runs.stream()`: Starts the run, and as the data is streamed, it will continuously send chunks of data to your system.
  - `webhook="https://my-server.app/my-webhook-endpoint"`: This is the URL where LangGraph will send the data once the run finishes. Your server must be prepared to accept **POST** requests at this endpoint.

### üì° Webhook Payload

When the webhook is triggered, it will send a **POST request** with data. This data typically includes information about the run and the result. Here's an example of the structure:

```json
{
  "run_id": "12345",
  "status": "completed",
  "output": "Task completed successfully!",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

Your server can extract this information and take the necessary actions.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Signing Webhook Requests for Security

To ensure that the requests are coming from LangGraph (and not from an unauthorized source), you can add a **token** in the webhook URL. This token will be checked by your server before processing the request.

Example webhook URL with a token:

```plaintext
https://my-server.app/my-webhook-endpoint?token=your_secure_token
```

- **Explanation**: The `token` is passed as a query parameter. When the webhook hits your server, your system will validate the token to ensure it's legitimate before processing the payload.

### üîë Real-World Use Case: E-commerce Order Updates

Let‚Äôs consider a real-world example of **e-commerce**:

- **Scenario**: You run an online store. When a customer places an order, your system triggers a webhook to notify the order service about the payment status. After processing the order, the service triggers another webhook to your system to update the order status.

In this case, the webhook helps you **automate** the communication between different systems (payment, order processing, and shipping), ensuring that the right actions are taken without manual intervention.

### üìç Key Points to Remember:

- **Webhooks** are used to send data automatically to a server when a specific event occurs.
- The **webhook URL** needs to be specified in the request, where the server will accept and process the data.
- Webhooks are particularly useful for handling real-time tasks like event notifications.
- **Security** is important; use a **token** in the URL to prevent unauthorized access.
