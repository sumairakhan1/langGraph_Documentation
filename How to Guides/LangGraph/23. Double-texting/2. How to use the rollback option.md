# 🌀 How to Use the Rollback Option

The rollback option in a system allows us to cancel or undo an action and make sure no trace of that action remains. This is used in various systems like databases, APIs, or applications where you might want to cancel the previous process and start fresh with a new one.

The rollback option is particularly useful in situations where you don't want the results from a previous action to interfere with a new one. It is similar to the **interrupt option**, but in this case, the first run is completely deleted and cannot be resumed. Let's dive into how this works and explore its applications with some examples.

## 🔄 What is Rollback?

The **rollback option** is used to undo the execution of a prior process (or "run") and start a new one. When you "rollback," the original process is deleted from the database, and it cannot be resumed or retrieved. This is often used in scenarios where you want to clean up after a failed or unwanted action.

In contrast, the **interrupt option** keeps the original action in the database, but marks it as interrupted, allowing you to start a new process without losing the previous one.

### 📌 Real-world Example: 
Imagine you are working on an **online shopping platform**. A customer starts an order, but before completing it, they change their mind and decide to shop for something else. The rollback option would be used here to completely remove their previous shopping session, ensuring they can start a fresh session.

## 🧰 Setup: Defining Helper Functions

Before running the rollback, we first define a helper function for printing the outputs of our actions in a clean format. Here's the function written in JavaScript:

```javascript
function prettyPrint(m) {
  const padded = " " + m['type'] + " ";
  const sepLen = Math.floor((80 - padded.length) / 2);
  const sep = "=".repeat(sepLen);
  const secondSep = sep + (padded.length % 2 ? "=" : "");

  console.log(`${sep}${padded}${secondSep}`);
  console.log("\n\n");
  console.log(m.content);
}
```

### 🧐 Explanation:
- **`padded = " " + m['type'] + " "`**: Adds spaces around the type of the message for formatting.
- **`sepLen`**: Calculates the length of the separator for aligning the message type.
- **`sep = "=".repeat(sepLen)`**: Creates a string of equal signs (`=`) for the separator.
- **`console.log`**: Outputs the formatted message and content to the console.

## 🚀 Create Runs with Rollback

Once the setup is complete, we can create the runs using the rollback strategy. Here’s how we do it:

```python
import asyncio
import httpx
from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messages
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)
assistant_id = "agent"
thread = await client.threads.create()

# First run will be rolled back
rolled_back_run = await client.runs.create(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in SF?"}]},
)

# Create a new run with the rollback strategy
run = await client.runs.create(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in NYC?"}]},
    multitask_strategy="rollback",  # Rollback strategy applied here
)

# Wait until the second run completes
await client.runs.join(thread["thread_id"], run["run_id"])
```

### 🧩 Explanation:
- **`client.runs.create()`**: This creates a new task (or "run") to execute a particular request (e.g., asking for weather info).
- **`multitask_strategy="rollback"`**: This tells the system to rollback the previous task and delete it from the database while starting a new one.
- **`await client.runs.join()`**: Waits for the new run to finish executing.

## 📊 View Run Results

After the rollback, we can view the results of the second (new) run.

```python
state = await client.threads.get_state(thread["thread_id"])

for m in convert_to_messages(state["values"]["messages"]):
    m.pretty_print()
```

### 🧩 Explanation:
- **`client.threads.get_state()`**: Fetches the current state of the thread (the ongoing process).
- **`convert_to_messages()`**: Converts the raw output to a readable message format.
- **`m.pretty_print()`**: Prints the result in a formatted way.

### 🔍 Sample Output:

```
================================ Human Message =================================
what's the weather in nyc?
================================== Ai Message ==================================
The weather API results show that the current weather in New York City is sunny with a temperature of around 85°F (29°C).
```

In the output, we can see that the original query (about San Francisco's weather) was completely removed and replaced by the new query (about New York's weather).

## ✅ Verifying the Rollback

We can verify that the original run was successfully deleted by trying to fetch its details. If it was deleted, we’ll get an error.

```python
try:
    await client.runs.get(thread["thread_id"], rolled_back_run["run_id"])
except httpx.HTTPStatusError as _:
    print("Original run was correctly deleted")
```

### 🧩 Explanation:
- **`await client.runs.get()`**: Attempts to fetch the details of the original run.
- If the run was deleted, an error (`HTTPStatusError`) will be thrown.

### Output:

```
Original run was correctly deleted
```

This confirms that the original run has been rolled back (i.e., deleted).

## 🛠️ Use Cases of Rollback

### 🎮 **Gaming**:
Imagine you are playing a game and reach a checkpoint, but the game crashes. You would use a rollback feature to undo the last action (e.g., losing progress) and restore the game state to the last successful save.

### 🏦 **Banking Systems**:
In case of a failed transaction, rollback ensures that no money is deducted from the user's account, and the transaction is canceled without leaving any traces.

### 📦 **E-commerce**:
If a customer starts a shopping cart but cancels it before checkout, the rollback option ensures that no unwanted orders are placed.

### 📚 Recap of Key Concepts:
- **Rollback** completely deletes the previous task and starts a fresh one.
- It's helpful for situations where you want to ensure there is no record or impact from a previous action.
- In real-world applications, rollback is used in gaming, banking, and e-commerce to ensure a clean state after interruptions.
