# How to Use the Enqueue Option in Double Texting

The **enqueue option** is a concept used in double texting, where multiple tasks (like messages) are processed in the order they are received, ensuring that the earlier task gets executed before the later one, even if both are triggered at the same time. In this guide, we‚Äôll explain how to implement the enqueue option using code examples, break down the purpose of each step, and provide real-world applications.

## üìù **What is Enqueue?**

In simple terms, **enqueue** is a queue-based system where tasks or messages are lined up in order, and each task waits for its turn to be processed. Think of it like waiting in a line at a coffee shop. The first person in line (the first task) gets served first, and the second person (the second task) has to wait their turn.

In double texting, this means when two messages are triggered at once, the system ensures that the first one is processed before the second one. This avoids confusion and ensures that tasks are completed in the correct order.

### **Real-World Use Case of Enqueue:**
Consider a customer support chatbot. Imagine a user asking for the weather in two cities simultaneously: "What's the weather in San Francisco?" and "What's the weather in New York?" By using enqueue, the chatbot will first process the San Francisco request, then handle the New York request, ensuring that both responses are correct and ordered properly.

## üîß **Setting Up the Environment**

Before we use the enqueue option, let's set up the necessary environment and tools.

### **JavaScript Helper Function**

First, we define a helper function to pretty-print messages. This function will display our messages clearly in the console.

```javascript
function prettyPrint(m) {
  const padded = " " + m['type'] + " ";
  const sepLen = Math.floor((80 - padded.length) / 2);
  const sep = "=".repeat(sepLen);
  const secondSep = sep + (padded.length % 2 ? "=" : "");

  console.log(`${sep}${padded}${secondSep}`);
  console.log("\n\n");
  console.log(m.content);
}
```

**Explanation of Code:**
1. `padded` adds some space around the message type for a cleaner display.
2. `sepLen` calculates the amount of padding required to center the message.
3. `sep` creates a separator line using `=` characters.
4. `console.log` is used to print the formatted message.

### **Purpose:**
This function will help us format the message output to make it easier to view and debug the results in the console.

## üöÄ **Using Enqueue in Code**

Now, let‚Äôs write the code to demonstrate how the enqueue option works by creating two runs (tasks), where the second task will interrupt the first one using the enqueue strategy.

### **Code for Creating Runs:**

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import asyncio
import httpx
from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messages
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

# Set up the client and thread
client = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)
assistant_id = "agent"
thread = await client.threads.create()

# Start the first run (task)
first_run = await client.runs.create(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf?"}]},
)

# Start the second run with enqueue strategy
second_run = await client.runs.create(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in nyc?"}]},
    multitask_strategy="enqueue",  # This is where we use the enqueue option
)
```

### **Explanation of Code:**
1. **Import Libraries:** We‚Äôre using `asyncio` for asynchronous tasks, `httpx` for making HTTP requests, and `langgraph_sdk` to interact with our language model.
2. **Create Client and Thread:** We create a client to interact with the model and start a new thread for the conversation.
3. **Create the First Run:** The first run simulates a user asking about the weather in San Francisco.
4. **Create the Second Run:** The second run asks about the weather in New York but uses the `multitask_strategy="enqueue"` option. This means the second task will wait in line and not interrupt the first one.

---

## üîÑ **Handling the Results of the Runs**

Once the tasks are created, we want to check the results to ensure they were processed in the correct order.

```python
# Wait for the second run to complete
await client.runs.join(thread["thread_id"], second_run["run_id"])

# Fetch the thread's state to get the messages
state = await client.threads.get_state(thread["thread_id"])

# Pretty print each message
for m in convert_to_messages(state["values"]["messages"]):
    m.pretty_print()
```

### **Explanation of Code:**
1. **Wait for Completion:** `client.runs.join()` ensures the second run is completed before we proceed.
2. **Get the Thread State:** `client.threads.get_state()` fetches the state of the thread, which contains all the messages from the runs.
3. **Convert and Print Messages:** The `convert_to_messages()` function converts the state data into messages, and `pretty_print()` is used to format and print them.

## üìä **Output Results**

After executing the above code, the output will look like this:

```
================================ Human Message =================================
what's the weather in sf?
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  tavily_search_results_json (toolu_01Dez1sJre4oA2Y7NsKJV6VT)
Args:
  query: weather in san francisco
...

================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: tavily_search_results_json
...

================================== Ai Message ==================================
According to AccuWeather, the current weather conditions in San Francisco are:
...
================================ Human Message =================================
what's the weather in nyc?
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  tavily_search_results_json (toolu_01FFft5Sx9oS6AdVJuRWWcGp)
Args:
  query: weather in new york city
...
```

### **Explanation of Output:**
1. **First Task Result:** The first message is related to the weather in San Francisco, which is processed first.
2. **Second Task Result:** After the first task finishes, the second message about New York is processed next. This shows how the enqueue option ensures the tasks are completed in the order they are added to the queue.

## üìå **Why Use Enqueue?**

Using **enqueue** ensures that tasks are processed in a specific order. This is especially useful when dealing with multiple tasks that need to be processed sequentially. For example:
- **Customer Support Chatbots:** Multiple users might ask questions at the same time, but each question needs to be answered in the order it was asked.
- **Automated Job Queues:** In scenarios like job scheduling, enqueue helps ensure that each task gets executed in the correct sequence, preventing potential issues like race conditions or task collisions.

---

## üìç **Summary**

The **enqueue option** allows tasks (or messages) to be processed in the order they are received. This is especially useful in situations where tasks need to be completed sequentially. By using simple code with strategies like `multitask_strategy="enqueue"`, you can manage tasks effectively and avoid issues like data overlap or confusion in processing. This concept is widely applicable in real-world systems like chatbots, task schedulers, and automated workflows.
