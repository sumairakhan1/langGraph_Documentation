# 🛑 **How to Use the Reject Option** 🚫

The **reject option** is used to handle situations where you want to prevent the continuation of a new run in a multi-tasking scenario and keep the original run going. This is useful when you want to stop an operation from being processed multiple times in parallel and ensure that only one operation is completed before another one can start. The reject option is especially useful in systems where tasks should not run concurrently if not necessary.

## 📝 **What is the Reject Option?**

In multi-tasking, when you initiate a task, you might want to ensure that a new task does not run concurrently if one is already in progress. The **reject option** will cancel the new task and allow the original task to continue its execution.

For example, let’s say you’re running a weather checking bot, and you try to check the weather for **San Francisco**. While the bot is still working, if you try to check the weather for **New York**, the bot will reject this second request, ensuring that the bot completes the San Francisco check before moving on to New York.

## 🔧 **How Does the Reject Option Work?**

Let’s break this down step by step. Here's a real-world example of using the **reject** option to prevent tasks from running concurrently.

### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Set Up Helper Functions**: 
   First, define a helper function to format the output from JavaScript and Curl model results.

   ```javascript
   function prettyPrint(m) {
       const padded = " " + m['type'] + " ";
       const sepLen = Math.floor((80 - padded.length) / 2);
       const sep = "=".repeat(sepLen);
       const secondSep = sep + (padded.length % 2 ? "=" : "");
       
       console.log(`${sep}${padded}${secondSep}`);
       console.log("\n\n");
       console.log(m.content);
   }
   ```

   **Explanation**: 
   - This function is used to print out the content in a formatted and clear way.
   - It calculates the length of the separator (`=`) based on the type of message to ensure a neat presentation.

2. **Instantiate the Client and Threads**: 
   Now, we instantiate the client and start the assistant with the `create()` method to establish a conversation thread.

   ```python
   import httpx
   from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messages
   from langgraph_sdk import get_client

   client = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>) 
   assistant_id = "agent"
   thread = await client.threads.create()
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - We’re using `httpx` and `langchain_core` to set up communication with the assistant, which will perform tasks like fetching weather information.

3. **Create a Task**: 
   We will start by running a task (such as getting the weather in San Francisco). This task will proceed as expected.

   ```python
   run = await client.runs.create(
       thread["thread_id"],
       assistant_id,
       input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf?"}]},
   )
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - This creates a new run for fetching the weather in San Francisco, which is the first task we initiate.
   
4. **Attempt a New Task with Reject Option**:
   Next, we attempt to start a second task (checking the weather in New York), but it will be rejected because we’ve already started one task.

   ```python
   try:
       await client.runs.create(
           thread["thread_id"],
           assistant_id,
           input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in nyc?"}]},
           multitask_strategy="reject",
       )
   except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
       print("Failed to start concurrent run", e)
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - Here, we use the `multitask_strategy="reject"` option to prevent the second task from running concurrently. 
   - The code catches the error and prints a message, confirming that the new task was rejected.

5. **Verify the Original Task**: 
   Finally, we verify that the first task (San Francisco weather) has completed successfully, and the rejected task does not run.

   ```python
   await client.runs.join(thread["thread_id"], run["run_id"])

   state = await client.threads.get_state(thread["thread_id"])

   for m in convert_to_messages(state["values"]["messages"]):
       m.pretty_print()
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - The `join()` method waits for the first task to complete.
   - Then, `get_state()` retrieves the current state of the thread, ensuring that only the first task (San Francisco weather) has completed.

### 🚨 **Output When Rejected**

When you attempt the second task while the first is still running, you’ll see this error:

```
Failed to start concurrent run Client error '409 Conflict' for url 'http://localhost:8123/threads/f9e7088b-8028-4e5c-88d2-9cc9a2870e50/runs'
```

The error code **409 Conflict** means that the system is refusing to allow the new task because a task is already in progress. It’s essentially telling us that the new run is not allowed to start while the previous one is still ongoing.

### ✅ **Results After First Task Completion**

After the rejection, the first task continues and provides a weather update for **San Francisco**:

```
The average high temperature in San Francisco in June is around 65°F (18°C), with average lows around 54°F (12°C).
```

### 🧑‍💻 **Real-World Example of the Reject Option**

Consider a **customer service chatbot** that handles multiple user queries. If a user asks for information about different products, the chatbot might need to reject simultaneous product queries to focus on one and give accurate answers. For example:
1. A user asks about a **laptop**.
2. While processing that, they also ask about a **smartphone**.
3. The chatbot rejects the smartphone query to finish the laptop inquiry and provide a complete answer.

In such scenarios, the **reject option** ensures that the bot doesn't process both queries simultaneously, which could cause confusion or errors in the responses.

## 🚀 **Key Points to Remember**
- **Reject Option** is used to prevent concurrent tasks from running.
- It throws an error to reject new tasks, ensuring only one task runs at a time.
- The **409 Conflict** error indicates that the task was rejected due to a running task.

With the **reject option**, you can maintain control over which tasks are allowed to run and ensure that tasks do not interfere with each other, resulting in more predictable behavior in systems that handle multiple requests.
