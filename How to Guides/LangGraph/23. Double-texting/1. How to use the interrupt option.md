# 1. How to use the interrupt option

# Interrupt in Double Texting 🛑

In this guide, we’ll dive deep into the concept of **interrupting** a previously running process in a program using a **double-texting approach**. Let’s break this down step by step, and I’ll walk you through real-world use cases and provide code examples to help you understand.

### What is an Interrupt in Double Texting? 🤔

In simple terms, **interrupting** means pausing the current task or process and starting a new one without completely removing the old process. Instead, the original process continues to exist in the background but gets marked as "interrupted."

#### Real-World Example 🌍

Imagine you're using a **voice assistant** on your phone, and you ask it, “What's the weather in San Francisco?” While it’s processing the answer, you quickly ask, “What's the weather in New York?” The assistant interrupts the first task (finding San Francisco's weather) and starts searching for New York’s weather. However, the San Francisco request isn't deleted; it's still there, but it’s considered "interrupted" because it didn’t complete.

---

### Why Use Interrupts? ⚡

Interrupts are useful when:

- **Time-sensitive actions**: You might want to prioritize newer requests over older ones.
- **Preventing Stale Responses**: If the previous request takes too long, starting a new one ensures that the user gets timely updates.
- **Handling Concurrent Tasks**: In systems that need to handle multiple requests at once, you can interrupt the current process to address more urgent tasks.

### Code Example 🖥️

We will use **Python** and the **LangChain** library to demonstrate this process. Here’s how it works step-by-step:

#### Step 1: Define the Helper Function 🎯

First, let’s write a helper function to make the output of our model more readable.

```python
def prettyPrint(m):
  padded = " " + m['type'] + " "
  sepLen = (80 - len(padded)) // 2  # calculate padding for separators
  sep = "=" * sepLen
  secondSep = sep + ("=" if len(padded) % 2 != 0 else "")
  
  # Print the formatted output
  print(f"{sep}{padded}{secondSep}")
  print("\n\n")
  print(m.content)
```

**Explanation of Code**:

- `padded = " " + m['type'] + " "`: This line adds spaces around the type of message (e.g., 'User' or 'AI') to make it look neat.
- `sepLen = (80 - len(padded)) // 2`: We calculate how much space we need to add before and after the padded type for alignment.
- `sep = "=" * sepLen`: This generates a separator using `=` to make it visually appealing.
- `print(f"{sep}{padded}{secondSep}")`: This prints the message type with separators to format it well.

#### Step 2: Import Packages and Setup Client 🔧

Now, let's import the necessary packages and set up our client:

```python
import asyncio
from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messages
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client(url="<DEPLOYMENT_URL>")  # URL to your server
assistant_id = "agent"  # ID of the agent
thread = await client.threads.create()  # Creates a new thread for conversation
```

**Explanation of Code**:

- `get_client(url="<DEPLOYMENT_URL>")`: This connects to your LangChain server at the specified URL.
- `assistant_id = "agent"`: This sets the assistant ID that will handle the tasks.
- `await client.threads.create()`: This creates a new conversation thread for handling multiple queries.

#### Step 3: Create and Interrupt Runs ⏳

Let’s start two runs: one will be interrupted by the second.

```python
# First run will be interrupted
interrupted_run = await client.runs.create(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in SF?"}]},
)

# Let’s pause briefly to simulate the interruption (simulating processing delay)
await asyncio.sleep(2)

# The second run, which interrupts the first one
run = await client.runs.create(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id,
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in NYC?"}]},
    multitask_strategy="interrupt",  # This specifies to interrupt the first task
)
```

**Explanation of Code**:

- `await client.runs.create()`: This creates a new run (a task to be executed).
- `multitask_strategy="interrupt"`: This key tells the system to interrupt any ongoing run and start a new one.

#### Step 4: Wait for Completion and View Results 👀

Finally, we will wait until the second run completes and print the results.

```python
await client.runs.join(thread["thread_id"], run["run_id"])

state = await client.threads.get_state(thread["thread_id"])

# Convert raw message data into a readable format
for m in convert_to_messages(state["values"]["messages"]):
    m.pretty_print()  # This will format the output nicely
```

**Explanation of Code**:

- `await client.runs.join()`: This ensures that we wait until the second run is completed.
- `convert_to_messages(state["values"]["messages"])`: This converts raw data into readable messages.
- `m.pretty_print()`: Prints the formatted output using the `prettyPrint` function defined earlier.

### Output 🌟

The output from the two queries will look like this:

```
================================ Human Message =================================

What's the weather in SF?

================================== Ai Message ==================================

[{'id': 'toolu_01MjNtVJwEcpujRGrf3x6Pih', 'input': {'query': 'weather in san francisco'}, 'name': 'tavily_search_results_json', 'type': 'tool_use'}]

Tool Calls:
  tavily_search_results_json (toolu_01MjNtVJwEcpujRGrf3x6Pih)
 Call ID: toolu_01MjNtVJwEcpujRGrf3x6Pih
  Args:
    query: weather in san francisco

================================= Tool Message =================================

Name: tavily_search_results_json

[{"url": "https://www.wunderground.com/hourly/us/ca/san-francisco/KCASANFR2002/date/2024-6-18", "content": "High 64F. Winds W at 10 to 20 mph. A few clouds from time to time. Low 49F. Winds W at 10 to 20 mph. Temp. San Francisco Weather Forecasts..."}]

================================ Human Message =================================

What's the weather in NYC?

================================== Ai Message ==================================

[{'id': 'toolu_01KtE1m1ifPLQAx4fQLyZL9Q', 'input': {'query': 'weather in new york city'}, 'name': 'tavily_search_results_json', 'type': 'tool_use'}]

Tool Calls:
  tavily_search_results_json (toolu_01KtE1m1ifPLQAx4fQLyZL9Q)
 Call ID: toolu_01KtE1m1ifPLQAx4fQLyZL9Q
  Args:
    query: weather in new york city
```

### Verifying the Interrupt 🔍

Finally, you can check if the original task was interrupted by running this code:

```python
print((await client.runs.get(thread["thread_id"], interrupted_run["run_id"]))["status"])
```

**Output**:

```
'interrupted'
```

This confirms that the initial task was successfully interrupted.

### Conclusion 🎓

Interrupting allows systems to handle real-time, multiple tasks effectively by halting a current process to prioritize newer ones. This is especially useful in voice assistants, real-time communication apps, or any system that requires efficient multitasking.
