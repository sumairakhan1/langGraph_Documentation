# 3. How to Pass Private State Between Nodes 🔄

In a StateGraph, sometimes nodes may need to exchange information that is crucial for intermediate steps, but not necessarily part of the graph’s input/output schema. This private data should only be shared between specific nodes and not affect the graph’s overall state. Let’s dive deeper into how to implement this.

## What is Private State? 🤔

Private state refers to data that is passed between nodes but doesn't become part of the public input/output schema of the graph. It allows nodes to share temporary data that is necessary for processing but isn’t relevant to the final result of the graph.

### Real-World Example 🌍

Imagine you’re building a shopping cart system. When a customer adds items to their cart, the system might calculate discounts or apply promotions behind the scenes (which is temporary data). This information might be shared between different steps (like between discount calculation and order confirmation), but the final output only includes the customer’s order details (items and prices), not the intermediate calculations.

## Setup: Install Required Packages 📦

Before you begin, let’s install the necessary package (`langgraph`) to work with StateGraph:

```bash
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph
```

---

## Define the Graph with Private State Between Nodes 🔧

### Step 1: Define Public and Private States

We’ll define the public state that all nodes share (the overall state) and private state that is passed between certain nodes.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
```

We now define the following:

1. **OverallState (Public State)** - This is the data shared across all nodes of the graph.
2. **Node1Output (Private State)** - This state will be used by node_1 and passed to node_2, but it won’t be shared with node_3.

```python
# Overall state (public data)
class OverallState(TypedDict):
    a: str

# Output from node_1 (private data)
class Node1Output(TypedDict):
    private_data: str
```

### Step 2: Implement Nodes with Private Data 🧑‍💻

We’ll implement three nodes:

1. **node_1**: Takes the overall state and generates private data.
2. **node_2**: Accepts the private data from node_1 and processes it.
3. **node_3**: Doesn’t have access to the private data, only the public state.

```python
# Node 1: Generates private data
def node_1(state: OverallState) -> Node1Output:
    output = {"private_data": "set by node_1"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_1`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output

# Node 2: Processes the private data from node_1
class Node2Input(TypedDict):
    private_data: str

def node_2(state: Node2Input) -> OverallState:
    output = {"a": "set by node_2"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_2`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output

# Node 3: Only has access to the public state (no private data)
def node_3(state: OverallState) -> OverallState:
    output = {"a": "set by node_3"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_3`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output
```

### Step 3: Build the StateGraph with Private Data 💡

Now, we build the graph and define how data flows from one node to another:

- We start at **node_1**, which generates private data.
- **node_2** receives that private data and updates the public state.
- **node_3** only receives the updated public state and outputs it.

```python
# Build the state graph
builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node(node_1)  # Add node_1
builder.add_node(node_2)  # Add node_2
builder.add_node(node_3)  # Add node_3

# Define the edges (data flow between nodes)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")  # Start from node_1
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")  # node_1 to node_2 (private data shared)
builder.add_edge("node_2", "node_3")  # node_2 to node_3 (only public state)
builder.add_edge("node_3", END)  # End after node_3

# Compile the graph
graph = builder.compile()
```

### Step 4: Invoke the Graph and View Results 🖥️

Now, let's invoke the graph and observe how data flows through the nodes.

```python
# Invoke the graph with the initial state
response = graph.invoke(
    {"a": "set at start"}
)

print()
print(f"Output of graph invocation: {response}")
```

### What Happens Here?

1. **node_1** is first invoked with the initial public state. It adds some private data (`"set by node_1"`) and returns it.
2. **node_2** then receives the private data from node_1 and modifies the public state.
3. **node_3** is the last node and only gets the public state from node_2, returning the final state.

### Output:

The output of the invocation shows how the private data is passed between nodes, but only the public state is visible at the end:

```text
Entered node `node_1`:
    Input: {'a': 'set at start'}.
    Returned: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}
Entered node `node_2`:
    Input: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}.
    Returned: {'a': 'set by node_2'}
Entered node `node_3`:
    Input: {'a': 'set by node_2'}.
    Returned: {'a': 'set by node_3'}

Output of graph invocation: {'a': 'set by node_3'}
```

## Conclusion 🌟

Passing private data between nodes is useful when you need intermediate information that shouldn't affect the graph’s public schema but is crucial for certain operations. By separating public and private states, you ensure that the data flow is clean and only relevant information is shared across the entire graph.

### Key Takeaways:
- Private data allows nodes to exchange temporary information not part of the public schema.
- The flow of data is managed using specific node connections.
- This concept is useful in scenarios like process pipelines where certain data is relevant only for intermediate steps.

### How to Define Private State in a StateGraph 🛠️

In a StateGraph, private state refers to data that is used by specific nodes for intermediate operations but isn't included in the public input/output of the graph. Private state is typically used when nodes need to share temporary information that isn’t relevant to the graph’s final result but is necessary for processing between certain nodes.

### Steps to Define Private State

Let’s go step-by-step on how you can define and use private state within a StateGraph.

---

## 1. **Define a Public State (Overall State)**

The public state is the overall data structure that all nodes share. It contains the data that flows through the graph and is exposed to the beginning and the end of the process.

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

# Public state class (OverallState)
class OverallState(TypedDict):
    a: str  # This is a public field that all nodes can access
```

In the code above, `OverallState` is the **public state**. Any data that is essential for the graph and should be available to all nodes is stored here. In this case, the public state contains a field `a`, which all nodes can use and modify.

---

## 2. **Define a Private State (Node-Specific State)**

Private state is the data that a node generates and shares only with certain nodes that need it. It is not included in the final output or made accessible to the public state.

You can define private state by creating a new class (using `TypedDict`) for the data that each node will share with others.

```python
# Private state specific to a node, for example, Node 1's output
class Node1Output(TypedDict):
    private_data: str  # This data will be used internally between nodes but not shared publicly
```

In this case, `Node1Output` is the **private state** for `node_1`. It contains a field `private_data`, which holds the private information that will only be accessible to the next node (node_2) and not shared with the entire graph.

---

## 3. **Use the Private State in Nodes**

After defining the private state, you can use it inside the node’s function. A node can generate private data and pass it to the next node that needs it. Private state is defined within each node’s function signature and should be passed as needed.

Here’s an example of **node_1** generating private data:

```python
# Node 1: Generates private data
def node_1(state: OverallState) -> Node1Output:
    output = {"private_data": "set by node_1"}  # Generates private state
    print(f"Entered node `node_1`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output
```

In the code above:
- `node_1` takes the public state `OverallState` as input.
- It generates `private_data` and returns it as part of the private state (`Node1Output`).

---

## 4. **Share Private State Between Nodes**

Private state is passed between nodes explicitly. Node 2 will take the private data from `node_1` and use it, but it won’t share it further with other nodes or include it in the final output.

Here’s an example of **node_2** using the private state from **node_1**:

```python
# Node 2: Accepts private data from node_1
class Node2Input(TypedDict):
    private_data: str  # Only accepts private data passed from node_1

def node_2(state: Node2Input) -> OverallState:
    output = {"a": "set by node_2"}  # Update the public state
    print(f"Entered node `node_2`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output
```

- `node_2` accepts the private data (`private_data`) passed from `node_1`.
- It does not modify or share the private state further but instead updates the **public state** (`OverallState`).

---

## 5. **Finalize the Graph with Public and Private Data**

Now, we’ll put it all together by connecting the nodes using a **StateGraph**. Only public state is passed to and from the start and end, but private state is passed between the nodes that need it.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# Build the state graph
builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node(node_1)  # Add node_1
builder.add_node(node_2)  # Add node_2
builder.add_node(node_3)  # Add node_3

# Define the edges (data flow between nodes)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")  # Start from node_1
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")  # node_1 to node_2 (private data shared)
builder.add_edge("node_2", "node_3")  # node_2 to node_3 (only public state)
builder.add_edge("node_3", END)  # End after node_3

# Compile the graph
graph = builder.compile()

# Invoke the graph with the initial public state
response = graph.invoke(
    {"a": "set at start"}
)

print(f"Output of graph invocation: {response}")
```

---

### Final Result 🔄

When the graph is invoked, **node_1** generates private data and shares it with **node_2**, which then uses it to update the public state. **node_3** only has access to the public state and outputs that:

```text
Entered node `node_1`:
    Input: {'a': 'set at start'}.
    Returned: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}
Entered node `node_2`:
    Input: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}.
    Returned: {'a': 'set by node_2'}
Entered node `node_3`:
    Input: {'a': 'set by node_2'}.
    Returned: {'a': 'set by node_3'}

Output of graph invocation: {'a': 'set by node_3'}
```

### Key Points to Remember 🔑

1. **Private State** is temporary data shared only between certain nodes and not part of the graph's final output.
2. **Public State** is data that flows through the entire graph and is accessible to all nodes.
3. Private state can be defined using `TypedDict` classes and passed from one node to another in the graph.
4. The graph only shares the **public state** at the start and end of the process, while private data is only relevant for intermediate steps.

By using private state, you can make your stateful graphs more modular and maintainable, separating data that is intermediate from data that is public-facing.
