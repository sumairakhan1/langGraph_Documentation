# How to Define Input/Output Schema for Your Graph 🌐

## Introduction 🌟

When creating a graph with **StateGraph**, by default, it uses a single schema for both input and output, meaning all nodes will expect and communicate data in the same structure. However, in some cases, you might want to define **distinct input and output schemas** for your graph. This means you can control how data enters and exits the graph, ensuring that the input data matches the expected structure, and the output data is filtered according to the desired output schema.

This feature is useful in various scenarios like:
- **Data filtering:** Ensure that nodes only return specific fields from the state.
- **Data validation:** Verify that the incoming data follows a predefined structure.
- **Separation of concerns:** Clearly distinguish the data coming into the graph and the data being returned by the graph.

Let's break this down step-by-step with a practical example.

## Prerequisites 📝

1. **StateGraph:** This is a graph structure where nodes can be connected to one another, with each node processing or transforming data. The StateGraph allows for communication between nodes, defining how data flows.
2. **TypedDict:** We will use Python’s **TypedDict** for the input and output schema. This provides type annotations to define a dictionary’s expected structure.

## Example Walkthrough 💡

### Step 1: Install Required Packages 🚀

Before starting, make sure you install the necessary packages. If you’re using a notebook environment, you can use the following command:

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph
```

This installs **LangGraph**, which is required for building the state graph.

### Step 2: Define Input and Output Schemas 🏗️

In the example, we will define two separate schemas: one for the input and one for the output.

1. **Input Schema (InputState):** This will define the structure of the input data, i.e., the data that nodes in the graph will receive.
2. **Output Schema (OutputState):** This will define the structure of the output data, i.e., the data that will be returned from the graph.

Here’s how we can define these schemas:

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

# Define the schema for the input (question)
class InputState(TypedDict):
    question: str

# Define the schema for the output (answer)
class OutputState(TypedDict):
    answer: str

# Define the overall schema by combining both input and output
class OverallState(InputState, OutputState):
    pass
```

- **InputState** has a key `question` which expects a string.
- **OutputState** has a key `answer` which expects a string as well.
- **OverallState** combines both input and output schemas to define the structure for the entire graph state.

### Step 3: Define the Nodes in the Graph 🌳

Now that we have the input and output schemas, we can define a **node** that processes the input and generates an output.

Here’s the code for the node:

```python
# Define the node that processes the input and generates an answer
def answer_node(state: InputState):
    # Generate an answer based on the input
    return {"answer": "bye", "question": state["question"]}
```

- The node takes `InputState` as input (a dictionary with a `question`).
- It returns an output dictionary with an `answer` and the same `question`.

### Step 4: Build and Compile the StateGraph 🛠️

Once the nodes are defined, you can build and compile the graph, specifying both the **input** and **output** schemas.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# Build the graph with input and output schemas specified
builder = StateGraph(OverallState, input=InputState, output=OutputState)
builder.add_node(answer_node)  # Add the answer node
builder.add_edge(START, "answer_node")  # Define the starting edge
builder.add_edge("answer_node", END)  # Define the ending edge
graph = builder.compile()  # Compile the graph
```

- **StateGraph** is initialized with `OverallState`, the combination of the input and output schemas.
- The **input** and **output** parameters are set explicitly to `InputState` and `OutputState` respectively.
- The **add_node()** function adds the `answer_node` to the graph.
- **add_edge()** connects the nodes, setting the flow from `START` → `answer_node` → `END`.
- **compile()** generates the final graph.

### Step 5: Invoke the Graph 🔄

Finally, we can invoke the graph with an input to see how it processes the data and returns the output.

```python
# Invoke the graph with an input and print the result
print(graph.invoke({"question": "hi"}))
```

The expected output will be:

```python
{'answer': 'bye'}
```

- The input `{"question": "hi"}` is passed into the graph.
- The node processes the input, and the output is filtered to include only the `answer` as per the `OutputState` schema.

## Real-World Use Case 🌍

### Example: Customer Support System 🧑‍💻

Imagine you are building a **customer support chatbot** that answers questions based on customer queries. Here’s how this concept could be applied:

- **Input Schema (InputState):** The input could include fields like `customer_query`, `customer_id`, `timestamp`, etc.
- **Output Schema (OutputState):** The output could only include relevant fields like `response_message`, `response_code`, etc.

Using distinct input and output schemas ensures that the incoming customer query data is validated, and only the necessary output data is returned to the user.

For example, if a customer asks, "What is the status of my order?", the bot would receive this query, process it, and only return a response like: `"Your order is on the way!"`, without returning any internal state.

## Code Summary 📝

Let’s summarize the code:

1. **InputState:** Defines the structure of the data the graph will receive (`question`).
2. **OutputState:** Defines the structure of the data the graph will return (`answer`).
3. **OverallState:** Combines both input and output schemas.
4. **answer_node:** A function that processes the input and generates an output.
5. **StateGraph:** A graph is built, nodes are added, edges are defined, and the graph is compiled.
6. **invoke:** The graph is invoked with a valid input, and the result is printed with the filtered output.

## Conclusion 🎯

In this guide, we explored how to define distinct **input** and **output** schemas in a **StateGraph**. By specifying these schemas, you can ensure that data flows through your graph in a structured way and that only relevant information is returned. This pattern is useful in scenarios where data validation, transformation, or filtering is necessary.
