# Using Pydantic Models for Graph State in LangGraph

In this guide, we'll explore how to use **Pydantic Models** as the graph state in **LangGraph**. We'll cover the following key concepts and provide code examples to make it easy to understand.

## üéØ What is Pydantic?

[Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) is a Python library for data validation using Python type annotations. It is commonly used to enforce runtime data validation, ensuring that the input data matches the expected format, types, and constraints. When using **Pydantic**, you can automatically generate error messages if the data does not meet the specified criteria.

## üå≥ What is a Graph State?

A **graph state** refers to the shared state across different nodes in a graph. In **LangGraph**, the graph consists of various nodes, and each node can modify or update the state. The overall graph state must be structured properly to ensure consistency and correctness across all nodes.

In LangGraph, the **state schema** defines the structure of this state. We can use a **Pydantic model** for this schema to enforce validation rules during runtime.

## üîß Prerequisites

Before diving into the code examples, here are the tools and concepts you'll need:

- **State**: The shared data that nodes can access and modify.
- **Nodes**: The individual components or steps in the graph that modify or work with the state.
- **Pydantic**: For runtime validation of inputs.

Let's break down the process into simple steps.

## üõ† Setup and Installation

To begin using **LangGraph** with **Pydantic**, you must install the necessary packages.

1. Install **LangGraph** (which includes Langchain for graph state management):

```bash
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph
```

2. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import getpass
import os
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from pydantic import BaseModel
```

## üß© Example 1: Using Pydantic for State Validation in a Single Node

### Step 1: Define the State Schema with Pydantic

Here, we create a Pydantic `BaseModel` class to define the **state schema**. This schema ensures that the state is validated at runtime.

```python
# Define the overall state of the graph
class OverallState(BaseModel):
    a: str  # Expecting a string type for 'a'
```

### Step 2: Define the Node Function

A **node** is a function that manipulates or reads the state. In this case, our node simply returns a dictionary with the key `'a'`:

```python
def node(state: OverallState):
    return {"a": "goodbye"}
```

### Step 3: Build the Graph

Now, we'll set up the **StateGraph** using the `OverallState` Pydantic model and add the node:

```python
# Build the state graph
builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node(node)  # Add the node to the graph
builder.add_edge(START, "node")  # Start the graph with the node
builder.add_edge("node", END)  # End the graph after the node
graph = builder.compile()
```

### Step 4: Invoke the Graph

Now, we can invoke the graph and provide a valid input to test the state validation:

```python
# Test the graph with a valid input
output = graph.invoke({"a": "hello"})  # Should pass because 'a' is a string
print(output)  # Output: {'a': 'goodbye'}
```

#### Output:
```
{'a': 'goodbye'}
```

### Step 5: Handle Invalid Inputs

If we pass an invalid input (where `a` is not a string), **Pydantic** will raise a validation error.

```python
try:
    graph.invoke({"a": 123})  # 'a' should be a string
except Exception as e:
    print("An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.")
    print(e)
```

#### Output:
```
An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.
1 validation error for OverallState
a
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]
```

---

## üîÑ Example 2: Using Multiple Nodes in a Graph

When multiple nodes are involved, Pydantic validates the state at each node, ensuring that the inputs are correct as the graph progresses.

### Step 1: Define the Nodes

Here we define two nodes: `bad_node` (which intentionally returns an invalid value) and `ok_node` (which returns a valid value).

```python
def bad_node(state: OverallState):
    return {"a": 123}  # Invalid, 'a' should be a string

def ok_node(state: OverallState):
    return {"a": "goodbye"}  # Valid, 'a' is a string
```

### Step 2: Build the Graph with Multiple Nodes

We add both nodes to the graph and connect them using edges:

```python
# Build the state graph
builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node(bad_node)
builder.add_node(ok_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "bad_node")
builder.add_edge("bad_node", "ok_node")
builder.add_edge("ok_node", END)
graph = builder.compile()
```

### Step 3: Invoke the Graph

Now, we test the graph with valid input:

```python
try:
    graph.invoke({"a": "hello"})
except Exception as e:
    print("An exception was raised because bad_node sets `a` to an integer.")
    print(e)
```

#### Output:
```
An exception was raised because bad_node sets `a` to an integer.
1 validation error for OverallState
a
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]
```

## üåç Real-World Use Case: Graph State with Validation

### Scenario: Workflow Automation

In a real-world scenario, you can use Pydantic-based graph state for **workflow automation**. For example, in an **order processing system**:

1. **Nodes** represent different stages of the order, such as:
   - Receiving an order
   - Validating payment
   - Shipping the order

2. **State validation** ensures that the data passing between nodes is valid at each stage. For example:
   - Ensure that the order ID is a string.
   - Validate that the payment amount is a valid float.

By using **LangGraph** and **Pydantic**, you can ensure that data is correctly validated before being processed further, reducing errors and improving system reliability.

## üìù Summary

- **Pydantic** ensures runtime validation of data.
- **StateGraph** from LangGraph lets you create workflows where the state is shared and modified by multiple nodes.
- Use **Pydantic models** to define and validate the shape of the graph's state.
- Invalid input automatically raises validation errors, making the system robust and reliable.

This approach helps automate workflows with confidence, ensuring that the state stays consistent and valid as the graph progresses.
