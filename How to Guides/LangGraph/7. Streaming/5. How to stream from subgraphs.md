# 5. How to stream from subgraphs

# 📌 **Streaming from Subgraphs in LangGraph**  

When working with **LangGraph**, you may need to **stream outputs from subgraphs** within a **parent graph**. This guide explains how to do that, providing step-by-step explanations and real-world applications.  

---

## 🏆 **What is Streaming in Subgraphs?**  

When you define a **graph with subgraphs**, data flows through both the **parent graph** and **subgraphs**. By default, streaming updates from subgraphs is **not included** in the parent graph's stream.  

To enable this, you need to set `subgraphs=True` in the **streaming method** of the parent graph.

## 🎯 **Real-World Use Case of Subgraph Streaming**  

Imagine a **chatbot** that interacts with users. The chatbot's workflow may involve different **sub-processes**:  

- 🔹 **Parent Graph**: Handles the **main conversation flow**.  
- 🔹 **Subgraph**: Handles a **specific task**, such as **fetching user data** or **processing AI-generated responses**.  

Streaming updates from subgraphs allows real-time tracking of **individual steps** inside these subgraphs.

## 🛠 **Setup: Installing LangGraph**  

Before using **LangGraph**, ensure you have installed it:  

```bash
pip install -U langgraph
```

💡 You can also set up **LangSmith** to **debug, monitor, and optimize** your LangGraph applications.

## 🚀 **Example: Streaming from Subgraphs**  

This example demonstrates how to create a **parent graph with a subgraph** and stream outputs from both.

---

### 🔹 **Step 1: Define the Subgraph**  

```python
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict

# Define the subgraph state
class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    foo: str  # This key is shared with the parent graph
    bar: str  # Additional subgraph-specific key

# Define the first subgraph node
def subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": "bar"}  # Assigns a value to "bar"

# Define the second subgraph node
def subgraph_node_2(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + state["bar"]}  # Concatenates foo and bar

# Build the subgraph
subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_2)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph_node_1")  # First node in subgraph
subgraph_builder.add_edge("subgraph_node_1", "subgraph_node_2")  # Flow of execution
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()  # Compile the subgraph
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**  
✅ We created a **subgraph** with two nodes:  
- **subgraph_node_1:** Assigns `"bar"` to `bar`.  
- **subgraph_node_2:** Updates `foo` by **concatenating** `foo` and `bar`.  

---

### 🔹 **Step 2: Define the Parent Graph**  

```python
# Define the parent graph state
class ParentState(TypedDict):
    foo: str  # Parent state only contains "foo"

# Define the first parent node
def node_1(state: ParentState):
    return {"foo": "hi! " + state["foo"]}  # Adds "hi!" before foo

# Build the parent graph
builder = StateGraph(ParentState)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)  # First node in parent graph
builder.add_node("node_2", subgraph)  # Second node is the subgraph
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")  # Parent graph starts here
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")  # Passes state from node_1 to subgraph
graph = builder.compile()  # Compile the graph
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**  
✅ **Parent Graph Nodes:**  
- **node_1:** Appends `"hi!"` before `foo`.  
- **node_2:** Calls the **subgraph**.  

✅ **Edges:**  
- The **parent graph** starts at `node_1`.  
- The **output of node_1** is passed into the **subgraph (node_2)**.  

---

## 🎥 **Step 3: Streaming from Parent Graph Only**  

```python
for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(chunk)
```

### 🔍 **Expected Output:**  
```python
{'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}}
{'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}}
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**  
- The **first output** is from `node_1`, which **modifies foo**.  
- The **second output** is from `node_2`, which is the **subgraph’s final result**.  
- 🚫 **We do not see intermediate subgraph updates!**  

---

## 🔥 **Step 4: Streaming from Parent and Subgraphs**  

To **stream updates from both** the **parent** and **subgraph**, use `subgraphs=True`:

```python
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"foo": "foo"},
    stream_mode="updates",
    subgraphs=True,
):
    print(chunk)
```

### 🔍 **Expected Output:**  
```python
((), {'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}})
(('node_2:1234-abc',), {'subgraph_node_1': {'bar': 'bar'}})
(('node_2:1234-abc',), {'subgraph_node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}})
((), {'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}})
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**  
✔️ **Now we see:**  
1. The **parent graph’s updates** (`node_1`).  
2. The **subgraph’s internal updates** (`subgraph_node_1` and `subgraph_node_2`).  
3. The **final output of the subgraph**.  

✔️ **Each update is prefixed** with a **namespace**, so we know which graph (parent/subgraph) is streaming the update.

---

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways**  

✅ **Default streaming** in a parent graph **does not show subgraph updates**.  
✅ To **stream subgraph updates**, use `subgraphs=True` in the `.stream()` method.  
✅ **Namespaces** in the output **help identify which graph the update is coming from**.  
✅ Streaming subgraph outputs is useful for **debugging, monitoring, and real-time processing** in **AI workflows**.

## 🎭 **Real-World Applications**  

📌 **1. AI Assistants & Chatbots:**  
- Parent graph = **Main conversation flow**  
- Subgraph = **Handling specific tasks** (e.g., fetching data, answering FAQs)  

📌 **2. Data Processing Pipelines:**  
- Parent graph = **Orchestrates multiple data tasks**  
- Subgraph = **Processes individual components** (e.g., cleaning, transformation)  

📌 **3. Workflow Automation:**
