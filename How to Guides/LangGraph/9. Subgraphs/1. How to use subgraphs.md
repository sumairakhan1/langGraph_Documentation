# 1. How to use subgraphs¶

# 🌟 **How to Use Subgraphs in LangGraph** 🚀  

Subgraphs help in structuring complex workflows by breaking them into smaller, manageable components. They are especially useful in **multi-agent systems**, where multiple processes (agents) communicate with each other.  

---

## 🔹 **What Are Subgraphs?**  

A **subgraph** is a smaller graph within a larger graph (parent graph). It operates as an independent workflow but interacts with the parent graph by sharing data (state).  

### 📌 **Real-World Use Case**  
Imagine a **customer support chatbot** that includes:  
1. A **main workflow** handling user queries.  
2. A **subgraph** for sentiment analysis that determines if the user is happy or frustrated.  
3. The main workflow decides how to respond based on sentiment analysis.  

---

## 🔹 **How Do Subgraphs Communicate?**  

There are **two main ways** subgraphs and parent graphs exchange data:  

1️⃣ **Shared Schema Keys**:  
   - Both graphs use the same keys to store and retrieve data.  
   - The subgraph is added as a **node** in the parent graph.  

2️⃣ **Different Schema Keys**:  
   - The parent graph **transforms** data before or after calling the subgraph.  
   - A **function node** handles calling the subgraph and adjusting the data.  

Let’s explore both cases with code examples!  

---

# 🛠 **Setup: Installing Required Packages**  

First, install `langgraph` if you haven’t already:  

```python
!pip install -U langgraph
```

You can also set up **LangSmith** to monitor your workflows.

---

## 🔹 **Adding a Subgraph with Shared State Keys**  

In this case, both graphs share **the same data keys**, making communication seamless.  

### ✅ **Step 1: Define the Subgraph**  

```python
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict

# Define the subgraph's state structure
class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    foo: str  # Shared key with parent graph
    bar: str  # Unique to the subgraph

# Define subgraph nodes (functions that process state)
def subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": "bar"}  # Adds a new key 'bar'

def subgraph_node_2(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + state["bar"]}  # Updates shared 'foo' key

# Build the subgraph
subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_2)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(subgraph_node_1, subgraph_node_2)

# Compile the subgraph
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()
```

### ✅ **Step 2: Define the Parent Graph**  

```python
# Define the parent graph's state structure
class ParentState(TypedDict):
    foo: str  # Shared key

# Define a node in the parent graph
def node_1(state: ParentState):
    return {"foo": "hi! " + state["foo"]}  # Modify 'foo'

# Build the parent graph
builder = StateGraph(ParentState)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
builder.add_node("node_2", subgraph)  # Add the compiled subgraph as a node
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")

# Compile the parent graph
graph = builder.compile()
```

### ✅ **Step 3: Execute the Graph**  

```python
for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}):
    print(chunk)
```

### 🔍 **Output Explanation**
```json
{'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}}
{'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}}
```
1. `node_1` processes `"foo"` and adds `"hi! "` to it.  
2. `node_2` (subgraph) modifies `"foo"` by appending `"bar"`.  

---

## 🔹 **Streaming with Subgraph Outputs**  

If you want **detailed output**, including subgraph steps, use `subgraphs=True`:

```python
for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}, subgraphs=True):
    print(chunk)
```

### 🔍 **Output Explanation**  
```json
((), {'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}})
(('node_2:...',), {'subgraph_node_1': {'bar': 'bar'}})
(('node_2:...',), {'subgraph_node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}})
((), {'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}})
```
- The **subgraph executes step-by-step**, showing intermediate states.  
- You can **trace execution inside the subgraph** easily.  

---

## 🌟 **Summary**  

✅ **Subgraphs** allow modular workflow design.  
✅ **Shared state keys** make communication simple.  
✅ **Compiled subgraphs** can be used as **nodes** in the parent graph.  
✅ **Streaming with subgraphs** helps in debugging and tracking execution.

## 🎯 **Real-World Applications of Subgraphs**
1. **Chatbots**:  
   - Parent graph handles conversations.  
   - Subgraph performs **sentiment analysis** before replying.  

2. **Multi-Agent Systems**:  
   - Agents use a **common memory** (shared state).  
   - Subgraphs manage **specific tasks** (e.g., knowledge retrieval).  

3. **Workflow Automation**:  
   - Parent graph handles **order processing**.  
   - Subgraph calculates **discounts and taxes** separately.  

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**  
- Try modifying the example to pass **custom parameters**.  
- Implement **a subgraph with different schema keys** for **data transformation**.  
- Use **LangSmith** to debug complex workflows.  

Would you like an example where **subgraphs use different schema keys**? Let me know! 😊

# 🚀 Understanding Subgraphs in LangGraph  

Subgraphs allow us to build complex systems with multiple interconnected components, each functioning as its own graph. This is especially useful in **multi-agent systems** where different agents work together while managing their own internal state.  

A common question when using subgraphs is:  
> **How do the parent graph and the subgraph communicate?**  

There are **two primary scenarios** when integrating subgraphs:  
1. **Shared schema keys** – The parent and subgraph share common keys for communication.  
2. **Different schemas** – The parent and subgraph use different state formats, requiring transformation.  

Let's go deep into the **second scenario**, where the parent and subgraph have different schemas, and explore how we can **invoke a subgraph inside a node function**.  

---

## 📌 **Real-World Example: Using Subgraphs in Multi-Agent Systems**  
Imagine building a **multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** for a search engine. Here:  
- The **parent graph** processes user queries.  
- The **subgraph** performs a background search operation, retrieving relevant documents.  
- The parent graph then integrates this information and generates a response.  

This structure ensures each agent in the system has its own logic but collaborates seamlessly.

# 🔥 **Adding a Node Function That Invokes a Subgraph**  
In this approach, we **do not share schema keys** between the parent graph and subgraph. Instead, we:  
1. Convert the **parent state** into the required **subgraph state**.  
2. Invoke the **subgraph** inside a node function.  
3. Convert the **subgraph output** back into the **parent graph state**.  

🚨 **Limitation:**  
> You **cannot invoke multiple subgraphs inside the same node**—each node can only call **one** subgraph.  

---

## 🛠 **Step-by-Step Code Implementation**  

### 1️⃣ **Define the Subgraph**  

First, we create a **subgraph** that processes two keys:  
- `bar` – Input to the subgraph  
- `baz` – Intermediate processing step  

```python
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict

# 🏗 Define the subgraph's state schema (Notice: No shared keys with the parent)
class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    bar: str
    baz: str

# 🎯 First subgraph node – modifies state by adding 'baz'
def subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"baz": "baz"}

# 🔄 Second subgraph node – modifies 'bar' using the new 'baz' value
def subgraph_node_2(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": state["bar"] + state["baz"]}

# 🔧 Create and compile the subgraph
subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_2)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph_node_1")
subgraph_builder.add_edge("subgraph_node_1", "subgraph_node_2")
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()
```

### **🔍 Explanation of Subgraph Code:**  
✅ We define a **state schema (`SubgraphState`)** with `bar` and `baz`.  
✅ `subgraph_node_1` modifies the state by adding `"baz"`.  
✅ `subgraph_node_2` appends `baz` to `bar`, creating the final `bar` value.  
✅ The **subgraph is built and compiled** using `StateGraph`.  

---

### 2️⃣ **Define the Parent Graph**  

Now, let's define a **parent graph** that:  
- Takes an input key `foo`.  
- Calls the subgraph inside a node function.  

```python
# 🏗 Define the parent graph's state schema
class ParentState(TypedDict):
    foo: str

# 🎯 First node in the parent graph - modifies 'foo'
def node_1(state: ParentState):
    return {"foo": "hi! " + state["foo"]}

# 🔄 Second node - Calls the subgraph and integrates results
def node_2(state: ParentState):
    # 🔄 Convert parent state to subgraph state
    response = subgraph.invoke({"bar": state["foo"]})
    
    # 🔄 Convert subgraph response back to parent state
    return {"foo": response["bar"]}

# 🔧 Create and compile the parent graph
builder = StateGraph(ParentState)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
builder.add_node("node_2", node_2)  # 🔥 Calls node_2, which invokes the subgraph
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")
graph = builder.compile()
```

### **🔍 Explanation of Parent Graph Code:**  
✅ `ParentState` defines a **state schema** with a `foo` key.  
✅ `node_1`: **Updates** `foo` by prepending `"hi! "` to it.  
✅ `node_2`:  
   - Converts **parent state** to **subgraph state** (`foo → bar`).  
   - Calls the **subgraph** using `subgraph.invoke()`.  
   - Converts **subgraph output** (`bar`) back to `foo`.  
✅ We **compile the parent graph** using `StateGraph`.  

---

### 3️⃣ **Execute and Observe Output**  
Now, let's execute our graph and **see the output at each step**.

```python
for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}, subgraphs=True):
    print(chunk)
```

#### **💡 Expected Output:**  
```
((), {'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}})
(('node_2:c47d7ea3-7798-87c4-adf4-2543a91d6891',), {'subgraph_node_1': {'baz': 'baz'}})
(('node_2:c47d7ea3-7798-87c4-adf4-2543a91d6891',), {'subgraph_node_2': {'bar': 'hi! foobaz'}})
((), {'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobaz'}})
```

### **🔍 Output Explanation:**  
✅ `node_1` modifies `foo`:  
   - `"foo"` → `"hi! foo"`.  
✅ `node_2` transforms `foo → bar` and **calls the subgraph**:  
   - `subgraph_node_1` adds `"baz"`.  
   - `subgraph_node_2` combines `"hi! foo" + "baz" → "hi! foobaz"`.  
✅ The **final output** in the parent graph is:  
   - `"foo" → "hi! foobaz"`.
