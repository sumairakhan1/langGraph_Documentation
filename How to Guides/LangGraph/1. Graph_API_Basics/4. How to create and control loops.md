# 🔄 **Creating and Controlling Loops in Graphs**

## 📌 **Introduction to Loops in Graphs**
Loops in graphs allow nodes to execute repeatedly under certain conditions. However, to avoid infinite execution, we must define a termination condition. This is typically achieved using **conditional edges** or **recursion limits**.

### 🎯 **Why Are Loops Important in Graphs?**
Loops in graphs are used in:
✅ **Workflow Automation** – Iterating through tasks until completion.  
✅ **AI Agents** – Running decision-making loops in AI workflows.  
✅ **Game Development** – Repeating actions until a certain game state is reached.  
✅ **Data Processing Pipelines** – Processing batches of data in cycles.

## ⚙ **Setting Up a Graph with a Loop**
To create a loop in a graph, we need:
1️⃣ **Nodes** – Represent different operations or states.  
2️⃣ **Edges** – Define how nodes transition.  
3️⃣ **Conditional Logic** – Determines when to stop looping.  

### 🔹 **Step 1: Install Required Packages**
Before writing code, ensure you have **LangGraph** installed. Run:

```sh
pip install -U langgraph
```

---

## 🛠 **Defining a Simple Graph with a Loop**
We'll create a graph with **two nodes (A and B)** that transition between each other until a condition is met.

### **📝 Code Example: Creating a Graph with a Loop**
```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# 📌 Define the state format (Data structure for storing loop information)
class State(TypedDict):
    # The 'aggregate' list will store our state and will be modified in each step
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

# 📌 Define Node A - Adds "A" to the state list
def a(state: State):
    print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": state["aggregate"] + ["A"]}

# 📌 Define Node B - Adds "B" to the state list
def b(state: State):
    print(f'Node B sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": state["aggregate"] + ["B"]}

# 📌 Create the Graph
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)  # Add node "A"
builder.add_node(b)  # Add node "B"

# 📌 Define a function that controls looping logic
def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    # If aggregate list has fewer than 7 elements, continue looping to 'b'
    if len(state["aggregate"]) < 7:
        return "b"
    else:
        return END  # Terminate when we reach 7 elements

# 📌 Define edges (connections between nodes)
builder.add_edge(START, "a")  # Start at node "A"
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)  # Conditional transition from "A"
builder.add_edge("b", "a")  # Transition from "B" back to "A"

# 📌 Compile the graph
graph = builder.compile()

# 📌 Run the graph with an empty state
result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})

print("\nFinal Result:", result)
```

---

## 📖 **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**
### **1️⃣ Define a State Format**
```python
class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
This defines the **structure of the state**, which stores a list (`aggregate`). The `operator.add` function allows appending new elements.

### **2️⃣ Define Node Functions**
```python
def a(state: State):
    print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": state["aggregate"] + ["A"]}
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
When node **"A"** executes, it:
✅ Prints the current state  
✅ Adds `"A"` to the list and returns the updated state  

```python
def b(state: State):
    print(f'Node B sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": state["aggregate"] + ["B"]}
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
When node **"B"** executes, it:
✅ Prints the current state  
✅ Adds `"B"` to the list and returns the updated state  

### **3️⃣ Define Looping Logic**
```python
def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    if len(state["aggregate"]) < 7:
        return "b"  # Continue looping
    else:
        return END  # Stop execution
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
✅ If the list contains fewer than 7 elements, the loop continues.  
✅ Otherwise, it stops execution by returning `END`.

### **4️⃣ Define Graph Structure**
```python
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
✅ We create a **graph** and add **nodes "A" and "B"** to it.  

```python
builder.add_edge(START, "a")  # Start at node A
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)  # Conditional transition from A
builder.add_edge("b", "a")  # Transition from B to A
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
✅ The graph starts at **node "A"**.  
✅ If the condition (`route`) is met, it moves from **"A" → "B"**.  
✅ Then **"B" loops back to "A"**, creating a **loop**.  

### **5️⃣ Running the Graph**
```python
graph = builder.compile()
graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
✅ Runs the graph, starting with an **empty list**.  
✅ Nodes **A** and **B** execute repeatedly until the list contains 7 elements.  

---

## 🛑 **Setting a Recursion Limit**
Sometimes, loops can run indefinitely. To **prevent infinite loops**, we set a **recursion limit**.

### **📝 Code Example: Setting Recursion Limit**
```python
from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError

try:
    graph.invoke({"aggregate": []}, {"recursion_limit": 4})
except GraphRecursionError:
    print("Recursion Error")
```

🔹 **What Happens Here?**  
✅ If the loop exceeds **4 iterations**, it raises an error (`GraphRecursionError`).  
✅ The `try-except` block **catches** this error and prints `"Recursion Error"`.  

---

## 🎯 **Real-World Use Cases**
🔹 **AI Chatbots** – Chatbots often loop between different states until the conversation ends.  
🔹 **Data Processing Pipelines** – Processing data in chunks until all data is processed.  
🔹 **Automation Scripts** – Repeating a task until a specific condition is met (e.g., file download completion).  
🔹 **Game Loops** – Repeating player actions until the game ends.

---

## ✅ **Key Takeaways**
✔ **Loops in graphs** allow repeated execution of nodes.  
✔ **Termination conditions** prevent infinite loops.  
✔ **Recursion limits** help avoid excessive execution.  
✔ **Real-world applications** include chatbots, automation, and data processing.  

---

## 🎯 **Conclusion**
Loops in graphs provide a powerful way to execute repetitive tasks while maintaining control over execution. By using **conditional edges** and **recursion limits**, we can ensure efficient and error-free execution.

# 🔄 Loops with Branches – A Detailed Explanation for Beginners

Loops are an essential concept in programming, allowing us to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. When dealing with complex workflows, loops can include **branches**, where execution can take multiple paths. This is useful in scenarios like decision-making systems, state machines, and AI workflows.

In this guide, we will:
- ✅ Explain how loops with branches work.
- ✅ Provide real-world use cases.
- ✅ Give a step-by-step breakdown of the code.
- ✅ Provide alternative implementations.

---

## 📌 **Understanding Loops with Branches**
Loops with branches introduce **multiple execution paths** instead of a single loop flow. This is commonly used in:
1. **Workflow automation** – Decision trees for customer support.
2. **AI model training** – Selecting different models based on accuracy.
3. **Game development** – Controlling different enemy AI behaviors.

---

## 📌 **Real-World Example: Customer Support Bot**
Imagine a chatbot that helps users troubleshoot issues. A user asks a question, and based on their responses, the bot follows different paths:

- **Path A**: If the user has an internet issue, suggest restarting the router.
- **Path B**: If the issue is slow speed, recommend a speed test.
- **Path C**: If no solution works, escalate to a human agent.

This branching mechanism ensures **dynamic** and **efficient** problem-solving.

---

## 📌 **Code Implementation: Loops with Branches**
Below is an implementation of a **graph-based loop with branching**. It uses the `langgraph` library to model a state machine.

```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# 📝 Define the state that holds a list (aggregate) to track steps
class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

# 🔄 Node A: Starting point
def a(state: State):
    print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

# 📌 Node B: First branching point
def b(state: State):
    print(f'Node B sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

# 🔹 Node C: One of the branches from B
def c(state: State):
    print(f'Node C sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

# 🔹 Node D: Another branch from B
def d(state: State):
    print(f'Node D sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

# 🏗️ Define the Graph structure
builder = StateGraph(State)

# 🛠️ Adding nodes to the graph
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)

# 🔁 Defining the looping condition
def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    if len(state["aggregate"]) < 7:  # Stops when length reaches 7
        return "b"
    else:
        return END

# 🔗 Defining edges (connections)
builder.add_edge(START, "a")  # Start at A
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)  # Loop decision after A
builder.add_edge("b", "c")  # B leads to C
builder.add_edge("b", "d")  # B leads to D
builder.add_edge(["c", "d"], "a")  # Both C and D loop back to A

# 🎯 Compile the graph
graph = builder.compile()

# 🚀 Running the Graph
result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
```

---

## 📌 **Code Explanation (Line by Line)**
| Line of Code | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| `class State(TypedDict)` | Defines a state to hold the list of visited nodes. |
| `def a(state: State):` | Function for Node A, logs its execution, and returns an updated state. |
| `def b(state: State):` | Function for Node B, similar to Node A. |
| `def c(state: State):` | Function for Node C, another path in the graph. |
| `def d(state: State):` | Function for Node D, another path in the graph. |
| `builder = StateGraph(State)` | Initializes the graph. |
| `builder.add_node(a)` | Adds Node A to the graph. |
| `def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:` | Defines the condition for stopping the loop. |
| `builder.add_edge(START, "a")` | Starts the graph execution at Node A. |
| `builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)` | Adds a conditional loop from A to B. |
| `builder.add_edge("b", "c")` | Adds an edge from B to C. |
| `builder.add_edge("b", "d")` | Adds an edge from B to D. |
| `builder.add_edge(["c", "d"], "a")` | Loops back to A from both C and D. |
| `graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})` | Runs the graph with an empty list as the initial state. |

---

## 📌 **Controlling Recursion Limit**
Sometimes, loops may continue indefinitely. To **limit execution**, we impose a **recursion limit**:

```python
from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError

try:
    result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []}, {"recursion_limit": 4})
except GraphRecursionError:
    print("Recursion Error")
```

### 📝 **Explanation**
- **`recursion_limit=4`** ensures that the graph does not execute more than **4 steps**.
- If it exceeds, a `GraphRecursionError` is raised.
- The `try-except` block **catches** this error and prints `"Recursion Error"`.

---

## 📌 **Alternative Implementations**
To strengthen your understanding, here are three alternative ways to implement loops with branches.

### 🏷️ **1. Using While Loop in Python**
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    if count % 2 == 0:
        print("Even Step")
    else:
        print("Odd Step")
    count += 1
```
🔹 **Explanation**: This alternates between `"Even Step"` and `"Odd Step"` before stopping at 5.

---

### 🏷️ **2. Using Recursion**
```python
def loop_branch(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    print(f"Step {n}")
    if n % 2 == 0:
        loop_branch(n - 1)  # Branch A
    else:
        loop_branch(n - 2)  # Branch B

loop_branch(6)
```
🔹 **Explanation**: This function **recursively calls itself** with different decrements based on even or odd numbers.

---

### 🏷️ **3. Using a Dictionary (State Machine Approach)**
```python
states = {
    "start": lambda: "state_a",
    "state_a": lambda: "state_b" if input("Go to B? (y/n) ") == "y" else "end",
    "state_b": lambda: "start"
}

current_state = "start"
while current_state != "end":
    current_state = states[current_state]()
```
🔹 **Explanation**: This simulates a **state machine** where execution depends on **user input**.

---

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways**
✅ Loops with branches allow dynamic decision-making.  
✅ They are useful in AI, automation, and game development.  
✅ We can control execution using recursion limits.  
✅ Different implementations include **while loops, recursion, and state machines**.

# 🔄 How to Create and Control Loops in LangGraph

In this guide, we'll explore how to build loops in LangGraph. Loops let you repeatedly execute parts of your graph until a termination condition is met. This is especially useful in iterative processes like simulations, repeated data refinement, or even chatbots that engage in multiple rounds of conversation until a goal is reached.

We'll cover:

- **Setting up a loop in your graph**
- **Using conditional edges for termination**
- **Controlling loop execution with recursion limits**
- **A real-world example** to show its practical usage

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case

Imagine a **customer support chatbot** that tries multiple solutions in a loop until the customer's issue is resolved. Each iteration, the bot can refine its answer by consulting different tools or APIs. The loop stops when a satisfactory solution is found or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

---

## 🛠 Setting Up Your Loop

When designing loops, you need a mechanism to terminate execution to prevent infinite loops. This is done by:

1. **Using Conditional Edges:** Direct the flow to the END node when a termination condition is satisfied.
2. **Setting a Recursion Limit:** Control the maximum number of iterations (or "supersteps") the graph will execute.

Let's walk through a simple example.

---

## 🚀 Example: Building a Loop

We'll create a graph that alternates between two nodes (`a` and `b`) and uses a conditional edge to stop the loop when a certain condition is met.

### 📌 Code Example

```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal

from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# Define our state with an 'aggregate' key.
# The operator.add reducer makes it append-only.
class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

# Node A: Prints the current state and appends "A"
def a(state: State):
    print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

# Node B: Prints the current state and appends "B"
def b(state: State):
    print(f'Node B sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

# Build the graph with our nodes
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)

# Define the routing function to control the loop.
# It decides whether to continue looping by sending control to node "b" or to end the graph.
def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    # Termination condition: Stop the loop if 'aggregate' has 7 or more elements.
    if len(state["aggregate"]) < 7:
        return "b"   # Continue to node B if the condition is not met.
    else:
        return END   # Terminate the loop by routing to the END node.

# Define the edges:
builder.add_edge(START, "a")         # Start the graph at node A.
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)  # From A, use 'route' to decide the next step.
builder.add_edge("b", "a")           # After node B, loop back to node A.
graph = builder.compile()            # Finalize and compile the graph.

# Visualize the graph (optional)
from IPython.display import Image, display
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

### 🔍 Line-by-Line Explanation

- **Imports & State Definition:**
  - `import operator`: Provides the built-in addition operator.
  - `Annotated, Literal, TypedDict`: Used to define our state schema with type annotations.
  - `StateGraph, START, END`: Core classes/constants from LangGraph.
  - **`class State(TypedDict):`**  
    Defines our state with one key, `aggregate`, which is a list.  
    **`Annotated[list, operator.add]`** means that every update to `aggregate` will be appended (not overwritten).

- **Node Definitions:**
  - **`def a(state: State):`**  
    - **Purpose:** Logs the current state and returns an update that appends `"A"` to the `aggregate` list.
    - **Logic:** `print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')` shows the current state, then returns `{"aggregate": ["A"]}`.
  - **`def b(state: State):`**  
    - **Purpose:** Logs the current state and returns an update that appends `"B"` to the `aggregate` list.
    - **Logic:** Works similarly to node A.

- **Graph Building:**
  - **`builder = StateGraph(State)`**  
    Initializes the graph with our state schema.
  - **`builder.add_node(a)` and `builder.add_node(b)`**  
    Registers nodes A and B in the graph.
  
- **Conditional Routing Function:**
  - **`def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:`**  
    This function decides the next node based on the current state.
  - **`if len(state["aggregate"]) < 7:`**  
    Checks if the length of the `aggregate` list is less than 7.
  - **`return "b"`**  
    If the condition is true, the next node will be `b`.
  - **`else: return END`**  
    Once 7 or more items are in `aggregate`, the function returns `END`, which terminates the loop.

- **Edge Setup:**
  - **`builder.add_edge(START, "a")`**  
    Sets the starting node of the graph to A.
  - **`builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)`**  
    After node A, the `route` function is called to determine whether to loop back to B or end the graph.
  - **`builder.add_edge("b", "a")`**  
    After node B finishes, control goes back to node A, creating a loop.
  - **`graph = builder.compile()`**  
    Compiles the graph, checking for errors and preparing it for execution.

- **Graph Visualization:**
  - **`display(Image(...))`**  
    Optionally visualizes the graph structure using Mermaid.js.

---

## 🛑 Controlling the Recursion Limit

If your loop might run indefinitely due to unexpected conditions, you can set a recursion limit. This limit stops the graph after a specified number of iterations, raising a `GraphRecursionError`.

### 📌 Code Example: Setting a Recursion Limit

```python
from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError

try:
    # Invoke the graph with a recursion limit of 4 supersteps.
    graph.invoke({"aggregate": []}, {"recursion_limit": 4})
except GraphRecursionError:
    print("Recursion Error")
```

### 🔍 Explanation

- **`from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError`**  
  Imports the error that will be raised if the recursion limit is exceeded.
- **`try: ... except GraphRecursionError:`**  
  Attempts to run the graph and catches the error if too many iterations occur.
- **`{"recursion_limit": 4}`**  
  Sets the maximum number of supersteps (iterations) to 4. If the graph exceeds this limit, a `GraphRecursionError` is raised, and "Recursion Error" is printed.

---

## 🎯 Summary

- **Loops in LangGraph** allow you to execute parts of your graph repeatedly until a condition is met.
- **Conditional edges** (using functions like `route`) decide whether to continue the loop or terminate by directing to the `END` node.
- **Recursion limits** help prevent infinite loops by limiting the number of iterations, ensuring your system remains responsive.
- **Real-World Use Case:**  
  Use loops for iterative problem solving, such as a chatbot iteratively trying to resolve a user's query or a process refining data until it meets quality standards.

This detailed explanation should help you understand how to build and control loops in LangGraph. If you have any more questions or need further examples, feel free to ask!

# 🔄 How to Create Loops with Branches in LangGraph

In this guide, we’ll dive deep into building loops with branches in LangGraph. This concept allows you to execute a sequence repeatedly—with branches that run in parallel—until a termination condition is met. This is useful for many real-world scenarios, such as iterative decision-making in chatbots, multi-step data processing, or simulation loops.

Below, you'll find detailed code examples with line-by-line explanations. Plus, we’ll show **three alternative examples** so you can grasp the concept strongly.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example

Imagine a **diagnostic chatbot** that performs multiple tests (branches) on a user's system.  
- **Loop:** The bot repeats testing until enough data is gathered.  
- **Branches:** Different tests run concurrently (e.g., network test and performance test).  
- **Termination:** Once the system’s health data reaches a threshold, the loop stops.

---

## 🚀 Example 1: Loop with Branches (Provided Example)

This example demonstrates a loop where one step (Node A) fans out to two nodes (B, then branches to C and D), and then the flow loops back to A. The loop continues until the `aggregate` list reaches a length of 7 or more.

```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# Define our state schema with an 'aggregate' list.
# The reducer operator.add appends new values to the list.
class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

# Node A: Prints current aggregate and appends "A"
def a(state: State):
    print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

# Node B: Prints current aggregate and appends "B"
def b(state: State):
    print(f'Node B sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

# Node C: Prints current aggregate and appends "C"
def c(state: State):
    print(f'Node C sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

# Node D: Prints current aggregate and appends "D"
def d(state: State):
    print(f'Node D sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

# Create the graph builder and add nodes.
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)

# Define a routing function to control the loop.
# If the aggregate list is shorter than 7, go to node "b".
# Otherwise, route to END.
def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    if len(state["aggregate"]) < 7:
        return "b"
    else:
        return END

# Set up edges:
builder.add_edge(START, "a")            # Start -> A
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route) # From A, decide to go to "b" or END based on route()
builder.add_edge("b", "c")              # From B -> C
builder.add_edge("b", "d")              # Also from B -> D (branching: C and D run concurrently)
builder.add_edge(["c", "d"], "a")       # After C and D complete, loop back to A

# Compile the graph.
graph = builder.compile()

# Visualize the graph (optional)
from IPython.display import Image, display
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

# Invoke the graph with an initial empty aggregate list.
result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
print("\nFinal result:", result)
```

### 📌 Line-by-Line Explanation

- **Imports & State Definition:**
  - `operator`, `Annotated`, `Literal`, `TypedDict`: Tools for type annotation and reducer logic.
  - **`class State(TypedDict):`**  
    Defines our state with a single key `aggregate`, which accumulates values using `operator.add`.

- **Node Functions:**
  - **`def a(state: State):`**  
    Prints the current state and appends `"A"`.
  - **`def b(state: State):`**  
    Prints the current state and appends `"B"`.
  - **`def c(state: State):`**  
    Prints the current state and appends `"C"`.
  - **`def d(state: State):`**  
    Prints the current state and appends `"D"`.

- **Graph Building:**
  - **`builder = StateGraph(State)`** initializes the graph with our state schema.
  - **`builder.add_node(...)`** registers nodes A, B, C, and D.

- **Routing Function:**
  - **`def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:`**  
    This function checks if `aggregate` length is less than 7.  
    - If yes, returns `"b"` (continue loop).  
    - Otherwise, returns `END` to terminate.

- **Edges Setup:**
  - **`builder.add_edge(START, "a")`** sets the starting node.
  - **`builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)`** uses the `route` function to decide the next step.
  - **`builder.add_edge("b", "c")`** and **`builder.add_edge("b", "d")`** create a branch from B.
  - **`builder.add_edge(["c", "d"], "a")`** merges the branches and loops back to A.

- **Graph Invocation:**
  - **`graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})`** runs the graph starting with an empty `aggregate` list.
  - The graph loops, appending "A", "B", "C", and "D" until termination.

- **Recursion Limit (Not Shown Here):**
  - You can set a recursion limit to force termination if needed (see next sections).

---

## 🔄 Alternative Example 1: Loop with Two Branches and a Different Termination Condition

In this alternative, we’ll use a different termination condition: stop looping when the aggregate length reaches 5. The structure is similar but uses only one branch from B to C before looping back.

```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Node B sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Node C sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)

# Terminate loop when aggregate length reaches 5.
def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    if len(state["aggregate"]) < 5:
        return "b"
    else:
        return END

builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)
builder.add_edge("b", "c")
builder.add_edge("c", "a")

print("\nFinal result (Alternative 1):", result)
```

### 📌 Explanation of Alternative 1

- **Nodes A, B, C**: Same as before, but only one branch from B to C.
- **Route Function**: Terminates the loop once `aggregate` has 5 items.
- **Edges**:  
  - **`a -> route -> b`** and **`b -> c -> a`** creates a simple loop with one branch.
- **Use Case**: Useful when you want a simpler loop that stops earlier.

## 🔄 Alternative Example 2: Loop with Three Concurrent Branches

In this example, after node A, the loop fans out into three nodes (B, C, and D) concurrently before looping back to A. The termination condition stops when the aggregate length reaches 9.

```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Node B sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Node C sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

def d(state: State):
    print(f'Node D sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)

# Terminate loop when aggregate length reaches 9.
def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    if len(state["aggregate"]) < 9:
        return "b"
    else:
        return END

builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)
# Fan out into three branches from B.
builder.add_edge("b", "c")
builder.add_edge("b", "d")
# Merge branches from C and D, then loop back to A.
builder.add_edge(["c", "d"], "a")
graph = builder.compile()

result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
print("\nFinal result (Alternative 2):", result)
```

### 📌 Explanation of Alternative 2

- **Nodes A, B, C, D**: Now we have a three-branch scenario.
- **Route Function**: Uses a termination condition when the aggregate has 9 items.
- **Edges**:  
  - **`a -> route -> b`** leads to a fan-out from B into C and D, which then merge back to A.
- **Use Case**: Ideal when multiple processes must run concurrently before merging.

## 🔄 Alternative Example 3: Loop with Conditional Branching Inside the Loop

In this alternative, the branch taken within the loop depends on a condition evaluated inside the route function. For instance, based on whether the aggregate length is even or odd, the loop can take different paths.

```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Node B sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Node C sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

def d(state: State):
    print(f'Node D sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)

# Terminate the loop when aggregate length reaches 7.
# Otherwise, if the length is even, go to "b"; if odd, go to "c".
def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", "c", END]:
    if len(state["aggregate"]) >= 7:
        return END
    elif len(state["aggregate"]) % 2 == 0:
        return "b"
    else:
        return "c"

builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)
# Let both paths converge by looping back from D to A.
builder.add_edge("b", "d")
builder.add_edge("c", "d")
builder.add_edge("d", "a")
graph = builder.compile()

result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
print("\nFinal result (Alternative 3):", result)
```

### 📌 Explanation of Alternative 3

- **Route Function**:  
  - Checks if the `aggregate` length is at least 7 to terminate.  
  - Otherwise, it chooses node `"b"` if the length is even, or node `"c"` if odd.
- **Edges**:  
  - **`a -> route -> b` or `c`**: The route dynamically determines the next node.
  - **`b` and `c`** both lead to **`d`**, which then loops back to **`a`**.
- **Use Case**: Demonstrates dynamic branching within loops based on internal state conditions.

## 🎯 Summary

- **Loops with Branches** in LangGraph allow you to create iterative workflows with multiple concurrent paths.
- **Conditional Edges:** Use routing functions to decide the next node based on the current state.
- **Termination Conditions:** Prevent infinite loops by setting a condition (e.g., list length) or using recursion limits.
- **Real-World Applications:** Useful in diagnostic workflows, iterative data processing, and complex decision-making systems.

These examples, along with the alternative variations, should help you understand how to design and control loops with branches in LangGraph. Feel free to experiment with these patterns to suit your specific application needs!
