## 🎯 What is LangGraph?  

LangGraph is a Python framework for **building structured workflows** in applications that involve **Large Language Models (LLMs), AI Agents, or any sequential processing tasks**.  

Think of LangGraph as a **flowchart** in code form:  
🔹 Each **node** represents a step in a process  
🔹 **Edges** define how data flows from one step to another  
🔹 The **graph executes** in a predefined order  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case  

**Scenario: Automating a Chatbot Response Flow**  

Imagine you’re building a **chatbot** that processes user queries in steps:  

1️⃣ **Step 1:** Identify the user's intent  
2️⃣ **Step 2:** Retrieve relevant information  
3️⃣ **Step 3:** Generate a response  

Instead of writing complex if-else logic, you can define a **sequence of steps** using LangGraph to keep the code modular and scalable.  

---

## 🏗️ Building a Sequential Workflow  

### 🔹 Step 1: Define the State  

Before building the graph, we define the **state schema**. This defines **what data will be stored and passed** between nodes.  

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    value_1: str  # A string field
    value_2: int  # An integer field
```

📌 **Explanation:**  
- `TypedDict` is used to define the structure of the state.  
- The **state** keeps track of **values** that will be updated at different steps in the process.  

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Define the Nodes  

Each **node** represents a step in the process. These functions receive the **current state** and return **updated values**.  

```python
def step_1(state: State):
    return {"value_1": "a"}  # Initializes value_1 as "a"

def step_2(state: State):
    current_value_1 = state["value_1"]  # Reads the existing value
    return {"value_1": f"{current_value_1} b"}  # Appends " b" to value_1

def step_3(state: State):
    return {"value_2": 10}  # Sets value_2 to 10
```

📌 **Explanation:**  
- **Step 1:** Initializes `value_1` as `"a"`.  
- **Step 2:** Appends `" b"` to `value_1`, demonstrating how **state updates persist** between nodes.  
- **Step 3:** Assigns `value_2 = 10`.  

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Define the Graph  

Now, we use **LangGraph** to create a **state graph** and connect the nodes in sequence.  

```python
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)  # Initialize a graph with the state schema

# Add nodes
graph_builder.add_node(step_1)
graph_builder.add_node(step_2)
graph_builder.add_node(step_3)

# Add edges (defining the sequence)
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
graph_builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
graph_builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")

# Compile the graph
graph = graph_builder.compile()
```

📌 **Explanation:**  
- **`StateGraph(State)`** initializes the graph with the defined state schema.  
- **`add_node(step_1)`** adds `step_1` to the workflow.  
- **`add_edge(START, "step_1")`** ensures the graph starts from `step_1`.  
- **Each step is connected sequentially** using `add_edge(from, to)`.  
- **`compile()`** finalizes the graph before execution.  

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Execute the Graph  

Now, let's **invoke the graph** by passing initial values into the state.  

```python
result = graph.invoke({"value_1": "c"})  # Start with value_1="c"

print(result)  # Output: {'value_1': 'a b', 'value_2': 10}
```

📌 **Explanation:**  
- The **initial state** is `{"value_1": "c"}`.  
- **Step 1** sets `"value_1"` to `"a"` (overriding `"c"`).  
- **Step 2** updates `"value_1"` to `"a b"`.  
- **Step 3** sets `"value_2"` to `10`.  

---

## ⚡ Using the Built-in `.add_sequence()`  

LangGraph provides a **shortcut** for defining sequences using `.add_sequence()`.  

```python
graph_builder = StateGraph(State).add_sequence([step_1, step_2, step_3])
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")

graph = graph_builder.compile()

result = graph.invoke({"value_1": "c"})

print(result)  # Output: {'value_1': 'a b', 'value_2': 10}
```

📌 **Why use `.add_sequence()`?**  
✅ **Cleaner code** – No need to manually add each edge.  
✅ **Easier to read and maintain** – Directly lists steps in order.  

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways  

🔹 **LangGraph** allows defining **structured workflows** for AI pipelines, chatbots, and other applications.  
🔹 **Nodes** represent individual steps, and **edges** define the execution order.  
🔹 **State persists between steps**, allowing updates at different stages.  
🔹 **.add_sequence()** simplifies the process of defining sequential workflows.  

---

## 🚀 Where Can This Be Used?  

✅ **Chatbots** – Structuring LLM-based conversations  
✅ **Data Pipelines** – Processing datasets in stages  
✅ **AI Model Training** – Automating multi-step model tuning  
✅ **Workflow Automation** – Handling tasks that require multiple decisions

# 🚀 How to Create a Sequence of Steps with LangGraph

In this guide, we'll explore how to construct a **sequential graph** in LangGraph. This means setting up a series of nodes (or steps) that run one after the other. We'll cover:

- **Building a sequential graph** using `.add_node` and `.add_edge`
- Using a built-in shorthand with `.add_sequence`
- A **real-world example** to show where this concept is useful
- **Detailed code examples** with line-by-line explanations

---

## 🔍 **What Is a Sequential Graph?**

A **sequential graph** is a series of steps executed in order. Each step is represented by a node (a Python function) that takes the current state, performs some logic, and returns an update. The state is passed along from one node to the next, allowing each step to modify or add to it.

### 🌍 **Real-World Example: Order Processing Workflow**

Imagine an online store where an order goes through these steps:
1. **Step 1:** **Order Received** – Record that the order has been received.
2. **Step 2:** **Order Processed** – Update the order with processing details.
3. **Step 3:** **Order Shipped** – Mark the order as shipped.

Using a sequential graph, you can design these steps so that each function updates the state accordingly.

---

## 🛠 **Setting Up the State**

First, we define our state. This is a schema that holds the data our graph will work with. In our simple example, we'll track two values.

### 📌 **Code: Define State**
```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

# Define our state schema with two keys:
# - value_1 (a string)
# - value_2 (an integer)
class State(TypedDict):
    value_1: str
    value_2: int
```

**Explanation:**
- **TypedDict**: A way to specify the keys and value types in our state.
- `value_1` and `value_2` are our two pieces of state data.

---

## 🛠 **Creating the Nodes (Steps)**

Each node is a function that takes the current state and returns updates for specific keys. In this example, we will create three steps:

### 📌 **Code: Define Nodes**
```python
# Step 1: Populate a value in the state.
def step_1(state: State):
    # Returns a new value for 'value_1'
    return {"value_1": "a"}

# Step 2: Update the same value by appending more text.
def step_2(state: State):
    current_value_1 = state["value_1"]  # Get the current value of 'value_1'
    # Update 'value_1' by appending " b" to it.
    return {"value_1": f"{current_value_1} b"}

# Step 3: Populate a different value in the state.
def step_3(state: State):
    # Returns a new integer for 'value_2'
    return {"value_2": 10}
```

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

- **`step_1` Function:**
  - **Input:** Current state.
  - **Action:** Sets `value_1` to `"a"`.
  - **Output:** A dictionary with the update for `value_1`.

- **`step_2` Function:**
  - **Input:** Current state.
  - **Action:** Reads the existing `value_1` (which should be `"a"` from step 1) and appends `" b"`.
  - **Output:** A dictionary with the updated `value_1`.

- **`step_3` Function:**
  - **Input:** Current state.
  - **Action:** Sets `value_2` to `10`.
  - **Output:** A dictionary with the update for `value_2`.

---

## 🏗 **Building the Graph**

We now use LangGraph's `StateGraph` to combine our nodes and define the flow using edges.

### 📌 **Code: Building the Graph with .add_node and .add_edge**
```python
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph

# Create a new StateGraph using our state schema
graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Add nodes to the graph
graph_builder.add_node(step_1)
graph_builder.add_node(step_2)
graph_builder.add_node(step_3)

# Define the sequence of execution using edges
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")   # Start -> step_1
graph_builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")  # step_1 -> step_2
graph_builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")  # step_2 -> step_3

# Compile the graph to perform basic structure checks and prepare it for execution
graph = graph_builder.compile()
```

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

- **`StateGraph(State)`**: Initializes a new graph with our defined state.
- **`add_node(step_1)`**: Adds `step_1` to the graph.
- **`add_edge(START, "step_1")`**: Sets the starting edge so that the graph execution begins with `step_1`.
- **`add_edge("step_1", "step_2")`**: Connects `step_1` to `step_2`.
- **`add_edge("step_2", "step_3")`**: Connects `step_2` to `step_3`.
- **`compile()`**: Checks the graph structure and finalizes it for running.

---

## 💡 **Using the Built-In Shorthand `.add_sequence`**

LangGraph also offers a shorthand to add a series of nodes in sequence.

### 📌 **Code: Using .add_sequence**
```python
# Create the graph and add a sequence of steps in one call
graph_builder = StateGraph(State).add_sequence([step_1, step_2, step_3])
# Ensure that the START node leads to the first step
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")

# Compile the graph
graph = graph_builder.compile()
```

**Explanation:**

- **`.add_sequence([step_1, step_2, step_3])`**: This method automatically adds each node in the list and creates the required sequential edges between them.
- **`add_edge(START, "step_1")`**: Still necessary to define the starting point of the graph.
- This shorthand simplifies the process when you have a clear linear flow of steps.

---

## 🔥 **Running the Graph**

Finally, we invoke the graph with an initial state. In our example, we only need to provide an initial value for `value_1`, even though it gets overwritten by the first node.

### 📌 **Code: Invoking the Graph**
```python
# Invoke the graph with an initial state value for 'value_1'
result = graph.invoke({"value_1": "c"})

# Print the final state after processing all nodes
print(result)
```

**Expected Output:**
```python
{'value_1': 'a b', 'value_2': 10}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Invocation:** We start with `{"value_1": "c"}`.
- **Step 1 (`step_1`)**: Overwrites `value_1` with `"a"`.
- **Step 2 (`step_2`)**: Updates `value_1` by appending `" b"` to `"a"`, resulting in `"a b"`.
- **Step 3 (`step_3`)**: Sets `value_2` to `10`.
- **Final State:** The final state shows `value_1` as `"a b"` and `value_2` as `10`.

## 🌟 **Real-World Application Recap**

### **Example: Order Processing System**

Imagine an order processing system where:

1. **Step 1:** **Record Order Received**  
   The system registers that an order has been placed.

2. **Step 2:** **Update Order Status**  
   The order status is updated to indicate processing has begun.

3. **Step 3:** **Confirm Shipping**  
   The order is marked as shipped.

This sequential process ensures that each step builds upon the previous one, creating a clear and traceable workflow for order management.
