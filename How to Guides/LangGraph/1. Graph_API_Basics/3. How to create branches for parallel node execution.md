# 🚀 How to Create Branches for Parallel Node Execution in LangGraph  

## 🔍 **Introduction**  
Parallel execution of nodes is crucial in optimizing workflows, improving efficiency, and reducing execution time in graph-based applications. LangGraph supports parallel execution using **fan-out and fan-in mechanisms**, which help execute multiple tasks simultaneously and merge results efficiently.  

### 📌 **Real-World Example**  
Consider an **AI-powered chatbot** that processes a user request by:  
1. **Extracting intent** (e.g., booking a flight, ordering food).  
2. **Fetching required data** (e.g., flight availability, menu items).  
3. **Generating a response** for the user.  

Using **parallel node execution**, the chatbot can **analyze intent and fetch data simultaneously** instead of sequentially, reducing response time.  

---

## 🛠 **Setting Up LangGraph**  
Before implementing parallel execution, install LangGraph:  
```bash
pip install -U langgraph
```
Additionally, you can set up **LangSmith** to monitor and debug workflows efficiently.

## ⚡ **How to Execute Graph Nodes in Parallel**  

In this example, we execute **Node A → (B & C in parallel) → D**.  

### 🔹 **Understanding the Flow**
- **Node A starts execution.**  
- **Nodes B and C execute in parallel after A completes.**  
- **Node D waits until both B and C finish before running.**  

### 📌 **Code Implementation**  
```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Any
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# 🔹 Define State to store aggregated results
class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]  # Append-only list

# 🔹 Define graph nodes (functions performing tasks)
def a(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "A" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "C" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

def d(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "D" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

# 🔹 Build the Graph
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)

# 🔹 Define execution flow
builder.add_edge(START, "a")  # Start with node A
builder.add_edge("a", "b")  # A → B
builder.add_edge("a", "c")  # A → C
builder.add_edge("b", "d")  # B → D
builder.add_edge("c", "d")  # C → D
builder.add_edge("d", END)  # D → END

# 🔹 Compile and execute graph
graph = builder.compile()
graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})

```

### ✅ **Code Breakdown**
| Line of Code  | Explanation |
|--------------|------------|
| `State(TypedDict)` | Defines the **state** to hold aggregated results. |
| `aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]` | Ensures **values are appended** rather than overwritten. |
| `def a(state: State) → dict` | Function that executes **Node A** and returns an updated state. |
| `builder.add_edge("a", "b")` | Specifies that **Node B** should execute after **Node A**. |
| `builder.add_edge("a", "c")` | Specifies that **Node C** should execute after **Node A**. |
| `builder.add_edge("b", "d")` | Ensures **Node D** runs after both **B** and **C**. |
| `graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})` | Executes the graph with an empty list as the initial state. |

### 🛠 **Execution Output**  
```
Adding "A" to []
Adding "B" to ['A']
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "D" to ['A', 'B', 'C']
{'aggregate': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']}
```
🔹 **Notice that B and C execute in parallel before D runs.**  

---

## 🔀 **Handling Additional Parallel Steps**
What if one branch has **more steps** than the other?  

### 📌 **Example:**  
Adding an **extra step (`b_2`) after Node B**:  

```python
def b_2(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B_2" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B_2"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(b_2)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)

builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_edge("a", "b")
builder.add_edge("a", "c")
builder.add_edge("b", "b_2")  # New step added after B
builder.add_edge(["b_2", "c"], "d")  # Waits for both b_2 and c
builder.add_edge("d", END)

graph = builder.compile()
graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
```

### ✅ **Execution Output**
```
Adding "A" to []
Adding "B" to ['A']
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "B_2" to ['A', 'B', 'C']
Adding "D" to ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B_2']
{'aggregate': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B_2', 'D']}
```
🔹 **Now, `b_2` executes after `b`, and D waits for both `b_2` and `c` before executing.**  

---

## ❓ **Conditional Branching in Parallel Execution**  

Sometimes, we may want **dynamic branching**, where execution depends on a condition.  

### 📌 **Example:**  
If `state["which"] == "cd"`, execute **C and D**.  
If `state["which"] == "bc"`, execute **B and C**.  

```python
def route_bc_or_cd(state: State):
    return ["c", "d"] if state["which"] == "cd" else ["b", "c"]

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)
builder.add_node(e)

builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route_bc_or_cd, ["b", "c", "d"])

for node in ["b", "c", "d"]:
    builder.add_edge(node, "e")

builder.add_edge("e", END)

graph = builder.compile()
graph.invoke({"aggregate": [], "which": "bc"})  # Runs B and C
graph.invoke({"aggregate": [], "which": "cd"})  # Runs C and D
```

### ✅ **Execution Output**
For `"which": "bc"`:
```
Adding "A" to []
Adding "B" to ['A']
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "E" to ['A', 'B', 'C']
```

For `"which": "cd"`:
```
Adding "A" to []
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "D" to ['A']
Adding "E" to ['A', 'C', 'D']
```

# 🚀 How to Create Branches for Parallel Node Execution

In this guide, we'll learn how to build **parallel node execution** in LangGraph. Parallel execution helps you run multiple nodes simultaneously, speeding up your graph operations. We’ll cover:

- **What is Parallel Execution?**
- **Real-World Use Case**
- **Step-by-Step Code Examples**
- **Fan-Out / Fan-In Patterns**
- **Conditional Branching**

Let's dive in!

## 🔍 What Is Parallel Node Execution?

Parallel execution means running several nodes (steps) at the same time rather than one after the other. This is achieved using **fan-out** (splitting into multiple branches) and **fan-in** (merging branches back together).

### ✨ Why Use Parallel Execution?
- **Speed:** Running tasks concurrently reduces overall processing time.
- **Efficiency:** It optimizes resource usage when tasks are independent.
- **Scalability:** Ideal for workflows where multiple tasks can be processed simultaneously.

### 🌍 Real-World Example: Data Aggregation Pipeline
Imagine a data pipeline that needs to fetch data from several independent sources (e.g., APIs). You can:
1. **Fan-out:** Launch parallel API calls.
2. **Fan-in:** Combine the fetched data into a single aggregate for further processing.

## 🛠 Setting Up LangGraph

Before you start, make sure to install LangGraph using:
```bash
pip install -U langgraph
```
Also, consider setting up [LangSmith](https://www.langsmith.com) to help debug and monitor your graph projects.

## 🔧 Understanding Reducers

Reducers are functions that control how state updates are applied. In our examples, we use a reducer to accumulate values in a list instead of replacing them.

- **Example Reducer:** `operator.add`  
  This reducer appends new list items to the existing list.

---

## 🌟 Example 1: Basic Fan-Out and Fan-In

### 📌 Code Example: Fan-Out from A to B and C, then Fan-In to D

```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# Define our state schema with an 'aggregate' list that uses a reducer to accumulate values.
class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

# Node A: The starting node that adds "A" to the aggregate.
def a(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "A" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

# Node B: Adds "B" to the aggregate.
def b(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

# Node C: Adds "C" to the aggregate.
def c(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "C" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

# Node D: Merges the outputs from B and C by adding "D".
def d(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "D" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

# Build the graph.
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)

# Create the edges for fan-out and fan-in:
builder.add_edge(START, "a")   # Start -> A
builder.add_edge("a", "b")       # A -> B (branch 1)
builder.add_edge("a", "c")       # A -> C (branch 2)
builder.add_edge("b", "d")       # B -> D (merging branch 1)
builder.add_edge("c", "d")       # C -> D (merging branch 2)
builder.add_edge("d", END)       # D -> End

# Compile the graph.
graph = builder.compile()

# Visualize the graph (optional)
from IPython.display import Image, display
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

# Invoke the graph with an initial empty list for 'aggregate'
result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []}, {"configurable": {"thread_id": "foo"}})
print("\nFinal result:", result)
```

### 🔍 Line-by-Line Explanation:

- **Imports:**
  - `operator.add`: Used as a reducer to combine lists.
  - `StateGraph`, `START`, `END`: Core classes/constants from LangGraph.
  - `Annotated`, `TypedDict`: For defining a typed state.

- **State Definition:**
  - `class State(TypedDict):`  
    Defines our state with one key, `aggregate`, which is a list that accumulates values using the reducer.

- **Node Functions:**
  - **`def a(state: State):`**  
    - **Purpose:** Start the process by adding `"A"`.
    - **Logic:** Prints current state and returns update `{"aggregate": ["A"]}`.
  - **`def b(state: State):`** and **`def c(state: State):`**  
    - **Purpose:** Run in parallel after A, each adding `"B"` or `"C"`.
    - **Logic:** Print and return their respective updates.
  - **`def d(state: State):`**  
    - **Purpose:** Merge the outputs from B and C.
    - **Logic:** After B and C finish, add `"D"` to the accumulated list.

- **Graph Building:**
  - **`builder = StateGraph(State)`**  
    Initializes the graph with our defined state.
  - **`add_node(...)`**: Registers nodes A, B, C, and D.
  - **`add_edge(START, "a")`**: Sets the entry point to node A.
  - **`add_edge("a", "b")` & `add_edge("a", "c")`**: Creates a **fan-out** from A to nodes B and C.
  - **`add_edge("b", "d")` & `add_edge("c", "d")`**: Both B and C connect to D (fan-in).
  - **`add_edge("d", END)`**: Marks the end of the graph.

- **Graph Execution:**
  - **`graph.invoke({"aggregate": []}, {"configurable": {"thread_id": "foo"}})`**  
    Invokes the graph with an initial empty list for the `aggregate` state. The `thread_id` is provided to manage parallel execution.
  - **Output:**  
    The print statements show the accumulation process:
    - `"A"` is added first.
    - `"B"` and `"C"` are added in parallel (order may vary).
    - `"D"` is added after both B and C complete.
    - **Final `aggregate`:** `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']`.

## 🌟 Example 2: Parallel Execution with Multiple Steps in a Branch

Sometimes, one branch may require more than one step before merging back into the main flow.

### 📌 Code Example: Adding an Extra Node in the B Branch

```python
# Node B_2: Additional step in the B branch.
def b_2(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B_2" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B_2"]}

# Rebuild the graph with the additional node b_2.
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(b_2)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)

# Define edges with an extra step in the B branch.
builder.add_edge(START, "a")        # Start -> A
builder.add_edge("a", "b")            # A -> B
builder.add_edge("a", "c")            # A -> C
builder.add_edge("b", "b_2")          # B -> B_2 (extra step in branch B)
# Merge the branches: Wait for both B_2 and C before executing D.
builder.add_edge(["b_2", "c"], "d")
builder.add_edge("d", END)

# Compile and visualize the graph.
graph = builder.compile()
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

# Invoke the graph.
result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})
print("\nFinal result:", result)
```

### 🔍 Line-by-Line Explanation:

- **New Node b_2:**
  - **`def b_2(state: State):`**  
    Adds `"B_2"` to the aggregate. This extra step shows that a branch can have multiple nodes.
  
- **Graph Edges:**
  - **`builder.add_edge("b", "b_2")`**  
    Ensures that after node B, the branch goes to b_2.
  - **`builder.add_edge(["b_2", "c"], "d")`**  
    **Key Point:** This edge uses a **list of nodes** (`["b_2", "c"]`) so that node D only executes when **both** b_2 and C have finished. This avoids D running twice.

- **Execution:**
  - The graph accumulates values as follows:
    - `"A"` is added by node A.
    - Branch B adds `"B"`, then `"B_2"`.
    - Branch C adds `"C"`.
    - Finally, node D adds `"D"` once both branches are complete.
  - **Final `aggregate`:** `['A', 'B', 'C', 'B_2', 'D']`

---

## 🔀 Conditional Branching

Sometimes, the branch taken depends on the state itself. Use conditional branching to decide which nodes to run.

### 📌 Code Example: Conditional Branching Based on State

```python
import operator
from typing import Sequence, Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# Define a state with two keys: one for aggregation and one for determining the branch.
class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    which: str  # This key will determine the branching

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "A" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "C" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

def d(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "D" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

def e(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "E" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["E"]}

# Build the graph.
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)
builder.add_node(e)
builder.add_edge(START, "a")  # Start -> A

# Conditional routing function that returns a sequence of node names based on state["which"].
def route_bc_or_cd(state: State) -> Sequence[str]:
    if state["which"] == "cd":
        return ["c", "d"]
    return ["b", "c"]

# List of intermediate nodes involved in conditional routing.
intermediates = ["b", "c", "d"]

# Add conditional edges from node A based on the function above.
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route_bc_or_cd, intermediates)

# After conditional nodes, all paths go to node E.
for node in intermediates:
    builder.add_edge(node, "e")
builder.add_edge("e", END)

# Compile and visualize the graph.
graph = builder.compile()
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

# Invoke graph with condition "bc"
print("\nInvoking with 'which': 'bc'")
result_bc = graph.invoke({"aggregate": [], "which": "bc"})
print("\nFinal result:", result_bc)

# Invoke graph with condition "cd"
print("\nInvoking with 'which': 'cd'")
result_cd = graph.invoke({"aggregate": [], "which": "cd"})
print("\nFinal result:", result_cd)
```

### 🔍 Line-by-Line Explanation:

- **State Definition:**
  - Adds a new key `which` that determines which branch to take.

- **Conditional Routing Function (`route_bc_or_cd`):**
  - **Logic:**  
    - If `state["which"]` equals `"cd"`, return the sequence `["c", "d"]`.
    - Otherwise, return `["b", "c"]`.
  - This function dynamically controls the branch based on the state.

- **Conditional Edge:**
  - **`builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route_bc_or_cd, intermediates)`**  
    - This tells the graph: from node A, decide which of the intermediate nodes (B, C, D) to execute based on the current state.

- **Subsequent Edges:**
  - Each intermediate node connects to node E, and then E leads to END.

- **Execution:**
  - When **`which`** is `"bc"`, nodes B and C execute, and then E is reached.
  - When **`which`** is `"cd"`, nodes C and D execute, followed by E.
  - The print outputs will reflect the different paths taken based on the condition.

---

## 🎯 Summary

- **Parallel Node Execution** allows multiple branches to process concurrently.
- **Fan-Out / Fan-In**:
  - **Fan-Out:** A node splits into multiple nodes (e.g., A → B and C).
  - **Fan-In:** Multiple nodes merge their results into one node (e.g., B and C → D).
- **Reducers** (like `operator.add`) enable accumulation of state updates, ensuring values are appended rather than overwritten.
- **Conditional Branching** lets you choose different paths based on state values, making your workflow flexible.
- **Real-World Applications:** Data aggregation pipelines, multi-source API calls, and complex workflow management in systems like order processing or conversational AI.
