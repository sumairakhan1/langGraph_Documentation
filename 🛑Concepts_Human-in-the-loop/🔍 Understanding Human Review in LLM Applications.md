# 🔍 **Understanding Human Review in LLM Applications**  

In applications that involve **Large Language Models (LLMs)** interacting with tools or making decisions, **human review** is crucial to ensure accuracy, security, and correctness. This guide will help you understand the role of **human review nodes** in **LLM pipelines**, along with real-world use cases, Python code examples, and detailed explanations.  

---

## 🧑‍🏫 **What is a Human Review Node?**  

A **human review node** is a mechanism in an **LLM application** that allows human intervention before executing critical actions, such as:  
✅ Calling an external tool  
✅ Running sensitive code  
✅ Making irreversible changes  

This ensures that an **LLM does not execute incorrect or harmful actions** without human oversight.  

🔹 **Example Scenario**:  
Imagine a **financial chatbot** that assists users in transferring money. Before executing a transaction, it might ask for **human approval** to prevent unauthorized transfers.  

---

## 🏗️ **How Does a Human Review Node Work?**  

1️⃣ The LLM **suggests** an action (e.g., calling an API or executing a command).  
2️⃣ The **human review node interrupts** the process and asks, *"Should we proceed?"*  
3️⃣ The human reviewer can:  
   - ✅ **Approve** the action → The system executes it.  
   - ✏️ **Modify** the request → The system updates the action before execution.  
   - ❌ **Reject & provide feedback** → The system revises its approach.  

---

## 💻 **Python Code Example: Human Review Node in Action**  

Below is a Python implementation of a **human review node** using a structured LLM framework:  

```python
from typing import Literal
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_review_node(state) -> Literal["call_llm", "run_tool"]:
    """
    Function to create a human review node.
    
    Steps:
    1. Interrupts execution for human validation.
    2. Captures review action (continue, update, feedback).
    3. Proceeds based on human input.
    """

    # Display tool request for human approval
    tool_call = state.get("tool_call", {})
    human_review = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            "tool_call": tool_call  # Surface tool call details for review
        }
    )

    # Extract human decision
    review_action, review_data = human_review

    if review_action == "continue":
        # Proceed with tool execution
        return "run_tool"

    elif review_action == "update":
        # Allow human to modify the request
        updated_message = review_data.get("updated_message")
        return {"goto": "run_tool", "update": {"messages": [updated_message]}}

    elif review_action == "feedback":
        # Log human feedback and request a new LLM response
        feedback_message = review_data.get("feedback_message")
        return {"goto": "call_llm", "update": {"messages": [feedback_message]}}
```

---

## 🧐 **Breaking Down the Code**  

### 📌 **Step 1: Define a Human Review Node**  
```python
def human_review_node(state) -> Literal["call_llm", "run_tool"]:
```
- This function acts as a **human review node**.  
- It receives the **current state** of the LLM pipeline.  
- It returns one of the following actions:  
  - `"call_llm"` → Modify the request and get a new response.  
  - `"run_tool"` → Proceed with executing the tool call.  

---

### 📌 **Step 2: Request Human Review**  
```python
human_review = interrupt(
    {
        "question": "Is this correct?",
        "tool_call": tool_call  # Show tool call details for review
    }
)
```
- The `interrupt` function **pauses execution** and prompts the human to review the tool request.  
- It surfaces **details of the tool call**, asking if it's correct.  

---

### 📌 **Step 3: Process Human Input**  
```python
review_action, review_data = human_review
```
- The human **chooses an action** (approve, modify, or reject).  
- Their decision is stored in `review_action`, and any additional input is in `review_data`.  

---

### 📌 **Step 4: Handle Review Decisions**  

#### ✅ **Option 1: Approve and Continue**  
```python
if review_action == "continue":
    return "run_tool"
```
- If the reviewer **approves**, the system proceeds with tool execution.  

#### ✏️ **Option 2: Modify Before Executing**  
```python
elif review_action == "update":
    updated_message = review_data.get("updated_message")
    return {"goto": "run_tool", "update": {"messages": [updated_message]}}
```
- If the reviewer **modifies the request**, the system **updates the message** before executing.  

#### ❌ **Option 3: Reject & Provide Feedback**  
```python
elif review_action == "feedback":
    feedback_message = review_data.get("feedback_message")
    return {"goto": "call_llm", "update": {"messages": [feedback_message]}}
```
- If the reviewer **rejects**, they provide feedback, and the system requests a **new LLM response**.

# 🔍 **1. Implementing Human Review in LangGraph**  

In **many AI applications**, tool calls may generate **sensitive information** or require **human oversight** before execution.  
For example, in **AI-assisted legal document drafting**, a human must **review** and **approve** the AI-generated legal terms before submission.  

### ✅ **How Human Review Works in LangGraph**  
1. **AI generates a tool call** (e.g., a request to call an API).  
2. **Execution is paused** (`interrupt()` is used to wait for human input).  
3. **A human reviews the tool call** and either:  
   - **Approves it** ✅ (execution continues)  
   - **Modifies it** ✏️ (updates the tool call before proceeding)  
   - **Rejects it with feedback** 🚫 (sends feedback to the AI to improve its response)  

---

## 📝 **Example: Implementing Human Review in LangGraph**  

```python
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command
from typing import Literal

def human_review_node(state) -> Command[Literal["call_llm", "run_tool"]]:
    """
    Human review function to validate tool calls before execution.
    
    - Interrupts execution for human review.
    - Returns a command to continue, update, or give feedback.
    """

    # The AI generates a tool call (e.g., an API request)
    tool_call = state.get("tool_call", {})

    # Pause execution and wait for human review
    human_review = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            "tool_call": tool_call  # Show the tool call for review
        }
    )

    # Human's decision
    review_action, review_data = human_review

    # If approved, continue execution
    if review_action == "continue":
        return Command(goto="run_tool")

    # If modified, update the tool call
    elif review_action == "update":
        updated_msg = get_updated_msg(review_data)  # Modify tool call
        return Command(goto="run_tool", update={"messages": [updated_msg]})

    # If feedback is given, send it back to the AI
    elif review_action == "feedback":
        feedback_msg = get_feedback_msg(review_data)
        return Command(goto="call_llm", update={"messages": [feedback_msg]})
```

# 🔄 **2. Multi-Turn Conversations in LangGraph**  

Multi-turn conversations involve **multiple back-and-forth interactions** between an **AI agent** and a **human**. This is useful when:  
✔️ The AI needs more information from the user.  
✔️ The user needs to refine their query.  
✔️ The conversation dynamically evolves.  

🔹 In **LangGraph**, multi-turn conversations involve:  
1. **A human input node** (`interrupt()` pauses execution).  
2. **An agent node** that processes the input and responds.  
3. **A loop** that continues the interaction until a stopping condition is met.  

---

## 📝 **Example: Multi-Turn Conversation in LangGraph**  

```python
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command

def human_input(state):
    """
    Handles human input during a multi-turn conversation.
    Pauses execution and waits for the user's response.
    """
    
    # Pause execution and get user input
    human_message = interrupt("What would you like to do next?")

    # Store the user message in the conversation history
    return {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "human",
                "content": human_message
            }
        ]
    }

def agent(state):
    """
    AI agent logic to process user input and respond.
    """
    
    # Get the last user message
    user_message = state["messages"][-1]["content"]
    
    # Generate an AI response
    response = f"Agent received your message: {user_message}"

    # Store the AI response in the conversation history
    return {
        "messages": state["messages"] + [
            {"role": "agent", "content": response}
        ]
    }
```
