# 📌 **Understanding Graph Layers and Routing Work Between Graphs**  

When working with complex workflows, we often need a structured way to distribute tasks among multiple subgroups or teams. This is where **graph-based architectures** come in. By **adding layers** to a system, we can implement a **top-down planning policy** that allows a supervisor (a top-level entity) to coordinate multiple teams efficiently.  

In this guide, we'll **deeply explore** the concepts of **layering graphs** and **routing work** in a hierarchical manner. We'll **break down** the provided code, explain each line, discuss **real-world applications**, and provide **alternative examples** to strengthen your understanding.

## 🏗 **Concept: Adding Layers to a Graph-Based System**  

### 🔹 **What are Layers in a Graph-Based System?**  
Layers represent **different levels of decision-making**. Instead of all components interacting directly, we introduce **an orchestrator** (a top layer) that distributes work among different sub-graphs (lower layers).  

### 🔹 **Why Use Layers?**  
1. **Improved Organization** 🏢 – Helps structure different responsibilities (e.g., Research Team, Writing Team).  
2. **Better Control** 🎛 – The supervisor ensures work is **distributed properly**.  
3. **Scalability** 📈 – More teams (sub-graphs) can be added without changing the entire system.  

### 🔹 **Real-World Example: Research and Writing Teams**  
Consider a company that writes **technical reports**. The workflow is divided as follows:  
- **Research Team** 🔍 – Collects and analyzes information.  
- **Writing Team** ✍️ – Writes the report based on research findings.  
- **Supervisor** 🏗 – Coordinates both teams and ensures smooth workflow.  

This layered approach ensures that work is **efficiently divided** and **managed** without conflicts.

## 📝 **Breaking Down the Code: Line-by-Line Explanation**  

### 📌 **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**  
```python
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
- `BaseMessage` is a foundational class for handling messages in LangChain.  
- It allows agents (like Research and Writing Teams) to **communicate** via a **shared state**.  

---

### 📌 **Step 2: Initialize the Language Model**  
```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
- We initialize **ChatOpenAI** using the latest GPT-4o model.  
- This **large language model (LLM)** helps process and generate text-based responses.  

---

### 📌 **Step 3: Create the Supervisor Node**  
```python
teams_supervisor_node = make_supervisor_node(llm, ["research_team", "writing_team"])
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
- Creates a **supervisor agent** that oversees two teams:  
  1. `"research_team"` 🔍  
  2. `"writing_team"` ✍️  
- This supervisor **decides which team to call next** based on the workflow.  

---

### 📌 **Step 4: Define the Research Team Function**  
```python
def call_research_team(state: State) -> Command[Literal["supervisor"]]:
    response = research_graph.invoke({"messages": state["messages"][-1]})
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
- Calls the **research graph** and provides it with the latest user message.  
- **state["messages"][-1]** retrieves the **most recent message** in the state.  

```python
    return Command(
        update={
            "messages": [
                HumanMessage(
                    content=response["messages"][-1].content, name="research_team"
                )
            ]
        },
        goto="supervisor",
    )
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
- **Updates the state** by adding the research team’s response to the message list.  
- Sets **goto="supervisor"**, meaning once research is done, control is returned to the supervisor.  

---

### 📌 **Step 5: Define the Writing Team Function**  
```python
def call_paper_writing_team(state: State) -> Command[Literal["supervisor"]]:
    response = paper_writing_graph.invoke({"messages": state["messages"][-1]})
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
- Similar to the research function but calls the **writing graph** instead.  

```python
    return Command(
        update={
            "messages": [
                HumanMessage(
                    content=response["messages"][-1].content, name="writing_team"
                )
            ]
        },
        goto="supervisor",
    )
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
- Updates the state with the **writing team’s response**.  
- Returns control back to the supervisor.  

---

### 📌 **Step 6: Define the Graph and Connect Nodes**  
```python
super_builder = StateGraph(State)
super_builder.add_node("supervisor", teams_supervisor_node)
super_builder.add_node("research_team", call_research_team)
super_builder.add_node("writing_team", call_paper_writing_team)
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
- Creates a **StateGraph**, which manages different nodes (teams).  
- Adds the **supervisor** and both teams as nodes.  

---

### 📌 **Step 7: Define How Nodes Interact**  
```python
super_builder.add_edge(START, "supervisor")
super_graph = super_builder.compile()
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
- **Defines workflow**:  
  - The **starting point** (`START`) is connected to the **supervisor**.  
  - The **supervisor** then routes tasks to the correct team.  

---

### 📌 **Step 8: Display the Graph (Visualization)**  
```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(super_graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
- Uses **Mermaid.js** to generate a **visual representation** of the workflow.  

---

### 📌 **Step 9: Run the Graph with Sample Input**  
```python
for s in super_graph.stream(
    {
        "messages": [
            ("user", "Research AI agents and write a brief report about them.")
        ],
    },
    {"recursion_limit": 150},
):
    print(s)
    print("---")
```
🔹 **Purpose:**  
- **Sends a message** ("Research AI agents and write a brief report about them.")  
- The supervisor routes this to the research team first, then the writing team.  
- **Prints each step** of the workflow.

### 🏥 **Example 1: Hospital Workflow**  
- **Supervisor:** Doctor  
- **Research Team:** Lab Technicians (analyze patient tests)  
- **Writing Team:** Medical Scribes (document patient history)  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Doctor asks for tests → Lab sends results → Scribe updates records  

---

### 📚 **Example 2: Publishing a Book**  
- **Supervisor:** Publishing Editor  
- **Research Team:** Authors (write book content)  
- **Writing Team:** Proofreaders (edit and format content)  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Author writes chapters → Editor reviews → Proofreader finalizes  

---

### 🛒 **Example 3: E-Commerce Order Processing**  
- **Supervisor:** Order Management System  
- **Research Team:** Warehouse (checks stock availability)  
- **Writing Team:** Logistics Team (arranges delivery)  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Order is placed → Warehouse confirms stock → Logistics team ships the order
