# 📌 **Hierarchical Agent Teams Explained in Depth**
Hierarchical Agent Teams are used when tasks become too complex for a single worker or when multiple workers need efficient coordination. This structure allows for **better task distribution** using a top-level supervisor and mid-level supervisors.

---

## 🎯 **Why Use Hierarchical Agent Teams?**
Imagine you are managing a **research and documentation team** for a large company. You have:
1. A **top-level manager** who oversees the project.
2. **Mid-level supervisors** for different departments (Research, Writing).
3. **Team members** working under each supervisor.

This hierarchical setup ensures:
- Work is divided efficiently.
- Communication remains structured.
- Large projects are easier to manage.

---

## 🏗 **Real-World Example**
### ✍️ Research and Documentation Team
- The **Research Team** collects data from the internet.
- The **Writing Team** organizes and formats the information into a document.
- A **Supervisor** assigns tasks and compiles the final report.

This is exactly what we implement in the given code.

---

# 🚀 **Step-by-Step Implementation**

## 🛠 **1. Setup and Dependencies**
First, we need to install necessary Python libraries.

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain_community langchain_anthropic langchain_experimental

import getpass
import os
```
### 🔍 **What This Code Does:**
- 📥 **Installs required libraries**: `langgraph`, `langchain_community`, etc.
- 🏗 **Imports system libraries**: `getpass`, `os` for handling API keys.

---

## 🔑 **2. Setting API Keys**
To access external services like OpenAI or Tavily, we set API keys.

```python
def _set_if_undefined(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"Please provide your {var}")

_set_if_undefined("OPENAI_API_KEY")
_set_if_undefined("TAVILY_API_KEY")
```
### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- This function **checks if an API key exists**.
- If not, it **prompts the user to enter it securely**.
- `os.environ[var]` stores the key for later use.

---

## 🔍 **3. Creating Research Team Tools**
### 🔹 **Purpose:** Fetching and scraping data from the web.

```python
from typing import Annotated, List
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.tools import tool

tavily_tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=5)

@tool
def scrape_webpages(urls: List[str]) -> str:
    """Scrape the provided web pages for detailed information."""
    loader = WebBaseLoader(urls)
    docs = loader.load()
    return "\n\n".join(
        [
            f'<Document name="{doc.metadata.get("title", "")}">\n{doc.page_content}\n</Document>'
            for doc in docs
        ]
    )
```
### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- **`tavily_tool`**: Uses **Tavily** (a search engine) to fetch results.
- **`scrape_webpages(urls)`**:
  - Uses **WebBaseLoader** to load webpages.
  - Extracts **content and metadata**.
  - Returns formatted content for further use.

### 🎯 **Real-World Use Case**
This tool is useful for:
- **Automated market research**: Scrape competitor websites for analysis.
- **News aggregation**: Gather articles on a topic.
- **Academic research**: Extract information for papers.

---

## 📄 **4. Creating Document Writing Tools**
### 🔹 **Purpose:** Creating, reading, and editing documents.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory
from typing import Dict, Optional
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

_TEMP_DIRECTORY = TemporaryDirectory()
WORKING_DIRECTORY = Path(_TEMP_DIRECTORY.name)
```
### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- `_TEMP_DIRECTORY` is a temporary folder for saving files.
- `WORKING_DIRECTORY` stores our document files.

---

### 📑 **4.1 Creating an Outline**
```python
@tool
def create_outline(
    points: Annotated[List[str], "List of main points or sections."],
    file_name: Annotated[str, "File path to save the outline."],
) -> Annotated[str, "Path of the saved outline file."]:
    """Create and save an outline."""
    with (WORKING_DIRECTORY / file_name).open("w") as file:
        for i, point in enumerate(points):
            file.write(f"{i + 1}. {point}\n")
    return f"Outline saved to {file_name}"
```
### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- **Creates an outline file** with bullet points.
- **Writes** each section title to the file.

### 🎯 **Use Case**
- **Book writing**: Plan chapters.
- **Content creation**: Structure blog posts.
- **Project documentation**: Organize ideas.

---

### 📖 **4.2 Reading a Document**
```python
@tool
def read_document(
    file_name: Annotated[str, "File path to read the document from."],
    start: Annotated[Optional[int], "The start line. Default is 0"] = None,
    end: Annotated[Optional[int], "The end line. Default is None"] = None,
) -> str:
    """Read the specified document."""
    with (WORKING_DIRECTORY / file_name).open("r") as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    if start is None:
        start = 0
    return "\n".join(lines[start:end])
```
### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- Reads a document **from start to end** or a specific range.
- Useful for **reviewing saved research**.

---

### 📝 **4.3 Writing a Document**
```python
@tool
def write_document(
    content: Annotated[str, "Text content to be written into the document."],
    file_name: Annotated[str, "File path to save the document."],
) -> Annotated[str, "Path of the saved document file."]:
    """Create and save a text document."""
    with (WORKING_DIRECTORY / file_name).open("w") as file:
        file.write(content)
    return f"Document saved to {file_name}"
```
### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- Saves the given **text content** into a file.
- Can be used for **saving research summaries**.

---

### ✏️ **4.4 Editing a Document**
```python
@tool
def edit_document(
    file_name: Annotated[str, "Path of the document to be edited."],
    inserts: Annotated[
        Dict[int, str],
        "Dictionary where key is the line number (1-indexed) and value is the text to be inserted at that line.",
    ],
) -> Annotated[str, "Path of the edited document file."]:
    """Edit a document by inserting text at specific line numbers."""
    with (WORKING_DIRECTORY / file_name).open("r") as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    sorted_inserts = sorted(inserts.items())
    for line_number, text in sorted_inserts:
        if 1 <= line_number <= len(lines) + 1:
            lines.insert(line_number - 1, text + "\n")
        else:
            return f"Error: Line number {line_number} is out of range."
    with (WORKING_DIRECTORY / file_name).open("w") as file:
        file.writelines(lines)
    return f"Document edited and saved to {file_name}"
```
### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- Inserts text at **specific line numbers**.
- Useful for **collaborative editing**.

---

## 🐍 **5. Running Python Code in the System**
```python
from langchain_experimental.utilities import PythonREPL

repl = PythonREPL()

@tool
def python_repl_tool(
    code: Annotated[str, "The python code to execute to generate your chart."],
):
    """Use this to execute python code."""
    try:
        result = repl.run(code)
    except BaseException as e:
        return f"Failed to execute. Error: {repr(e)}"
    return f"Successfully executed:\n{code}\nStdout: {result}"

# 📌 **Understanding Hierarchical Agent Teams in AI Systems**  

In this guide, we will break down the concept of **Hierarchical Agent Teams** in AI applications. We’ll explain each part of the implementation in a simple and beginner-friendly manner, with **real-world examples** and **Python code** to illustrate how it works.  

---

## 🏗 **What are Hierarchical Agent Teams?**  

In AI-driven applications, multiple agents often collaborate to complete complex tasks. Instead of having all agents work independently, **hierarchical structures** allow for **better organization, efficiency, and task delegation**.  

💡 **Example in the Real World:**  
Imagine a **news agency** that collects and writes reports:  
- A **supervisor** assigns different parts of research and writing to journalists.  
- A **research team** collects information from sources.  
- A **writing team** compiles the research into an article.  
- A **final review team** edits and finalizes the article before publishing.  

This hierarchical structure ensures a smooth workflow and prevents confusion.  

---

## 🛠 **Creating Helper Utilities for Agent Teams**  

To make it easier to create **supervisors** and **worker agents**, we define some **helper functions**. These functions:  
✅ Create **worker agents** dynamically.  
✅ Create **supervisors** that assign tasks to the right agents.  

---

## 📝 **Step-by-Step Code Breakdown**  

### 1️⃣ **Importing Required Modules**  

Before we build our AI system, let's import the necessary libraries.  

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Literal
from langchain_core.language_models.chat_models import BaseChatModel

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END
from langgraph.types import Command
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, trim_messages
```

🔍 **Explanation:**  
- `typing` → Helps define types like `List`, `Optional`, and `Literal`.  
- `BaseChatModel` → Represents an AI language model that can chat.  
- `StateGraph`, `MessagesState` → Used to build **state-based workflows** in LangGraph.  
- `START`, `END` → Mark the **beginning** and **end** of an AI workflow.  
- `Command` → Represents actions an agent can take.  
- `HumanMessage`, `trim_messages` → Handle human-like messages in AI communication.  

---

### 2️⃣ **Defining State for Agents**  

```python
class State(MessagesState):
    next: str
```

🔍 **Explanation:**  
- `State` → This class **inherits** from `MessagesState`, meaning it stores messages exchanged in the system.  
- `next: str` → Keeps track of the **next agent or action** to execute.  

💡 **Real-World Analogy:**  
This is like a **task manager** keeping track of which worker should handle the next step in a project.  

---

### 3️⃣ **Creating a Supervisor Node**  

The **supervisor** is responsible for assigning tasks to workers.  

```python
def make_supervisor_node(llm: BaseChatModel, members: list[str]) -> str:
    options = ["FINISH"] + members
    system_prompt = (
        "You are a supervisor tasked with managing a conversation between the"
        f" following workers: {members}. Given the following user request,"
        " respond with the worker to act next. Each worker will perform a"
        " task and respond with their results and status. When finished,"
        " respond with FINISH."
    )
```

🔍 **Explanation:**  
- `make_supervisor_node(llm, members)` → Creates a **supervisor agent** using an AI model (`llm`).  
- `members: list[str]` → List of **worker agents** that can be assigned tasks.  
- `options = ["FINISH"] + members` → Adds `"FINISH"` as a possible response, meaning work is done.  
- `system_prompt` → Defines instructions for the **AI-powered supervisor**, telling it how to assign tasks.  

💡 **Real-World Analogy:**  
This is like a **team lead** reading a project request and deciding which **team member** should handle it next.  

---

### 4️⃣ **Defining How the Supervisor Routes Work**  

Now, we define a **TypedDict** to specify the structure of responses and create the supervisor function.  

```python
    class Router(TypedDict):
        """Worker to route to next. If no workers needed, route to FINISH."""
        next: Literal[*options]
```

🔍 **Explanation:**  
- `Router(TypedDict)` → Defines a dictionary structure where `next` represents **which agent should act next**.  
- `Literal[*options]` → The **next step** must be either a worker name or `"FINISH"`.  

---

### 5️⃣ **Implementing the Supervisor Logic**  

```python
    def supervisor_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[*members, "__end__"]]:
        """An LLM-based router."""
        messages = [
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        ] + state["messages"]
        response = llm.with_structured_output(Router).invoke(messages)
        goto = response["next"]
        if goto == "FINISH":
            goto = END

        return Command(goto=goto, update={"next": goto})
```

🔍 **Explanation:**  
- `def supervisor_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[*members, "__end__"]]`:  
  - Defines a **supervisor function** that takes in the current **state**.  
  - Returns a `Command` that tells which agent should act next.  

- `messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}] + state["messages"]`:  
  - Creates a **list of messages** that includes system instructions and past messages.  

- `response = llm.with_structured_output(Router).invoke(messages)`:  
  - Calls the AI model (`llm`) to decide **which agent should act next**.  
  - Ensures the output follows the `Router` structure.  

- `goto = response["next"]`:  
  - Extracts the **next worker's name** from the AI response.  

- `if goto == "FINISH": goto = END`:  
  - If the AI supervisor says `"FINISH"`, we mark the workflow as **complete**.  

- `return Command(goto=goto, update={"next": goto})`:  
  - Returns a **command** that moves the workflow to the selected worker.  

💡 **Real-World Analogy:**  
Imagine a **call center supervisor** listening to a customer request and deciding:  
- If the request is about **billing**, send it to the **Billing Team**.  
- If it's about **technical issues**, send it to the **Support Team**.  
- If everything is resolved, **end the conversation**.  

---

## 🏆 **Summary: How the Supervisor Works**  

1️⃣ The **supervisor** gets a task request.  
2️⃣ It analyzes past messages and instructions.  
3️⃣ It picks the **right worker agent** (or finishes the task).  
4️⃣ The workflow continues until **all tasks are done**.  

---

## 💡 **Real-World Applications of Hierarchical Agent Teams**  

✅ **Customer Support Bots** → Direct user queries to the right department.  
✅ **Automated Research Systems** → Collect and summarize information from different sources.  
✅ **AI-Powered Content Creation** → Research, write, and edit documents automatically.  
✅ **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** → Distribute tasks among different AI agents.  

---

## 🎯 **Final Thoughts**  

Hierarchical Agent Teams **help manage complexity** by breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts. Using **AI-powered supervisors**, we can create intelligent systems that **automatically assign, monitor, and complete tasks** efficiently.
