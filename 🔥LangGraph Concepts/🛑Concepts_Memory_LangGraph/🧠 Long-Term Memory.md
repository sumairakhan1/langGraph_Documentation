# üß† Long-Term Memory in LangGraph

Long-term memory in **LangGraph** allows systems to **retain information across different conversations or sessions**. This is different from short-term memory, which only lasts during a single session. Long-term memory is useful for applications like **personalized AI assistants, chatbots, and knowledge retrieval systems**.

---

## üìå **Why Do We Need Long-Term Memory?**
Imagine interacting with an AI assistant that **remembers your preferences** across multiple conversations. For example:
- A customer support chatbot remembers your previous complaints.
- A virtual tutor keeps track of your learning progress.
- A medical AI assistant retains patient history across sessions.

This is achieved by **storing user data in structured namespaces** so that relevant information can be retrieved later.

---

## üèó **How LangGraph Stores Long-Term Memories**
LangGraph stores long-term memory as **JSON documents** in a **store**. Each memory is:
1. **Organized under a custom namespace** (like a folder).
2. **Given a unique key** (like a filename).
3. **Searchable using content filters** to quickly retrieve relevant data.

### üóÇ **Namespaces and Keys**
- A **namespace** is a **higher-level category** (e.g., a user ID).
- A **key** is a **specific memory entry** within the namespace.

This makes memory retrieval **efficient and structured**.

---

## üìù **Code Example: Storing and Retrieving Long-Term Memory**
Let‚Äôs look at a Python example where we:
1. **Store user preferences** in memory.
2. **Retrieve stored memory** based on user ID.
3. **Search memory** using content filters.

### üöÄ **Code Implementation**
```python
# Import necessary module
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

# Function to create vector embeddings (dummy function for now)
def embed(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]:
    # Replace with an actual embedding function in a real application
    return [[1.0, 2.0] * len(texts)]

# Create an in-memory store (Use a real database for production)
store = InMemoryStore(index={"embed": embed, "dims": 2})

# Define user details and application context
user_id = "my-user"
application_context = "chitchat"
namespace = (user_id, application_context)  # Defines the memory location

# Store user preferences in memory
store.put(
    namespace,   # Namespace: User + Application
    "a-memory",  # Unique key for this memory
    {
        "rules": [
            "User likes short, direct language",
            "User only speaks English & Python",
        ],
        "my-key": "my-value",
    },
)

# Retrieve stored memory using the namespace and key
item = store.get(namespace, "a-memory")
print("Retrieved Memory:", item)

# Search for stored memories using filters
items = store.search(
    namespace,  # Look inside this namespace
    filter={"my-key": "my-value"},  # Filter by key-value pair
    query="language preferences",  # Search query
)
print("Search Results:", items)
```

# üß† Understanding Long-Term Memory in AI with LangGraph  

Long-term memory is crucial for AI systems to retain information across different sessions, enabling more personalized and intelligent interactions. This guide will explain long-term memory in **LangGraph**, how it works, different memory types, and practical implementation with **Python code** examples.  

---

## üîç What is Long-Term Memory in AI?  

In AI, **long-term memory** allows a system to **store, retrieve, and update** information beyond a single conversation. Unlike **short-term memory**, which only lasts for the duration of a session, long-term memory persists over multiple interactions, enabling AI models to remember user preferences, past interactions, and learned facts.  

### üìå Real-World Example  
Imagine you're using a **smart personal assistant** like **Google Assistant** or **Alexa**. When you ask it,  
*"Remind me to buy groceries every Saturday,"*  
it **remembers** this instruction and reminds you weekly.  

Without long-term memory, the assistant would **forget** and you'd have to set the reminder **every time** manually.  

---

## üìÇ How LangGraph Stores Long-Term Memories  

LangGraph stores long-term memory as **JSON documents** inside a **custom namespace** (like folders) and a **distinct key** (like a filename). This makes it easy to organize and retrieve specific pieces of information.  

### üèó Memory Storage Structure  
1. **Namespace** ‚Üí A label for grouping memories (e.g., per user or app context).  
2. **Key** ‚Üí A unique identifier for a memory (e.g., "user_preferences").  
3. **Memory Data** ‚Üí A JSON object containing the stored information.  

### ‚úÖ Code Example: Storing and Retrieving Memory in LangGraph  

```python
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore  # Import in-memory storage

# Function to generate simple vector embeddings (placeholders for real embeddings)
def embed(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]:
    return [[1.0, 2.0] * len(texts)]  # Dummy embedding values

# Creating an in-memory store (use a database-backed store for production)
store = InMemoryStore(index={"embed": embed, "dims": 2})

# Define a namespace (user-specific memory storage)
user_id = "user123"
application_context = "chat_app"
namespace = (user_id, application_context)

# Storing user preferences in long-term memory
store.put(
    namespace,
    "user_preferences",
    {
        "rules": [
            "User prefers short, direct responses.",
            "User speaks only English and Python.",
        ],
        "theme": "dark_mode",
    },
)

# Retrieving stored memory
retrieved_memory = store.get(namespace, "user_preferences")
print(retrieved_memory)

# Searching within stored memories
search_results = store.search(namespace, filter={"theme": "dark_mode"}, query="user preferences")
print(search_results)
```

### üìù Code Explanation  
1. **`InMemoryStore`** ‚Üí Creates a temporary storage for memory (use a database in production).  
2. **`embed` function** ‚Üí Generates dummy embeddings (vector representations of text for search).  
3. **Namespace** ‚Üí Groups user memories (`user_id` + `application_context`).  
4. **`store.put(...)`** ‚Üí Saves memory under `"user_preferences"` with user rules and preferences.  
5. **`store.get(...)`** ‚Üí Retrieves stored memory for a given user.  
6. **`store.search(...)`** ‚Üí Searches within stored memories using filters.  

### üî• Real-World Application  
- **Chatbots** remembering user preferences (e.g., preferred language, past questions).  
- **Recommendation systems** storing user interests (e.g., preferred movie genres).  
- **Smart assistants** tracking user schedules, tasks, and reminders.

# üß† Understanding Episodic Memory in AI  
Episodic memory plays a crucial role in both human cognition and artificial intelligence (AI). It helps humans recall past experiences and enables AI agents to remember past interactions or sequences of actions. This concept is particularly important in machine learning and large language models (LLMs) to improve performance over time.  

---

## üìå What is Episodic Memory?  
Episodic memory refers to the ability to recall specific events or experiences that happened in the past. In humans, this means remembering things like:  
‚úÖ A vacation trip from last year  
‚úÖ A meeting you attended yesterday  
‚úÖ A meal you had last week  

Similarly, **AI agents** use episodic memory to remember past actions and improve their responses based on prior interactions.  

### üîπ Difference Between Semantic and Episodic Memory  
| Memory Type  | What is Stored? | Human Example | AI Example |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| **Semantic Memory** | Facts and concepts | Remembering that Paris is the capital of France | Storing user preferences like "User prefers dark mode" |
| **Episodic Memory** | Past experiences and events | Remembering a specific trip to Paris | Recalling how a user interacted with an AI chatbot in a past session |

---

## üéØ How is Episodic Memory Used in AI?  
In AI, episodic memory is used to recall past interactions and improve future decision-making. Some real-world applications include:  

### üè¶ 1. **Personalized Chatbots**  
- AI assistants like **ChatGPT** or **Google Assistant** can remember past conversations to provide a more personalized experience.  
- Example: If you previously asked a chatbot for book recommendations, it can recall that and suggest similar books in future interactions.  

### üöó 2. **Self-Driving Cars**  
- Self-driving cars store past driving experiences to improve navigation and avoid accidents.  
- Example: If the car encounters a challenging road condition (e.g., a sharp turn or a high-traffic area), it remembers that situation to drive more cautiously next time.  

### üéÆ 3. **Game AI Learning from Players**  
- AI in games can remember player behavior to adjust difficulty levels dynamically.  
- Example: If a player frequently takes cover while shooting, the enemy AI may change its strategy to counter this behavior.  

### ü§ñ 4. **Customer Support Systems**  
- AI-powered customer service agents can recall previous issues a user had and offer better solutions.  
- Example: If a user complained about an internet connectivity issue last time, the AI might ask whether the problem persists before suggesting solutions.  

---

## üõ† How AI Uses Episodic Memory?  
Episodic memory in AI is often implemented using **few-shot learning**.  

### üîç **What is Few-Shot Learning?**  
Few-shot learning is a technique where a machine learning model learns from a few examples instead of requiring a large dataset. It helps AI adapt to new tasks without extensive training.  

Example: Instead of training an AI from scratch to recognize handwritten digits, few-shot learning allows it to learn quickly by showing just a few examples.  

---

## üìù Code Example: Few-Shot Learning for Episodic Memory  
Let‚Äôs implement a simple **few-shot learning** example where an AI chatbot remembers past conversations using **Python** and **OpenAI's GPT-4 API**.

### üìå **Code Explanation**
```python
import openai

# Define past interactions (Episodic Memory)
past_interactions = [
    {"user": "What is the capital of France?", "bot": "The capital of France is Paris."},
    {"user": "What is 2 + 2?", "bot": "2 + 2 is 4."}
]

# Function to generate a response based on past memory
def generate_response(user_input):
    prompt = "You are an AI assistant. Here are past conversations:\n"
    
    # Adding past interactions to the prompt
    for interaction in past_interactions:
        prompt += f"User: {interaction['user']}\nBot: {interaction['bot']}\n"
    
    # Adding the new user query
    prompt += f"User: {user_input}\nBot:"

    # Call OpenAI API to generate response
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]
    )
    
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

# Example usage
user_query = "What is the capital of Germany?"
response = generate_response(user_query)
print(response)
```

---

### üßê **Breaking Down the Code**
üîπ **Step 1: Storing Past Conversations**  
```python
past_interactions = [
    {"user": "What is the capital of France?", "bot": "The capital of France is Paris."},
    {"user": "What is 2 + 2?", "bot": "2 + 2 is 4."}
]
```
- This list stores previous conversations to help the AI remember what was discussed earlier.  

üîπ **Step 2: Constructing the Prompt**  
```python
prompt = "You are an AI assistant. Here are past conversations:\n"
```
- This initializes the prompt for the AI with previous conversations.  

üîπ **Step 3: Adding Past Interactions to the Prompt**  
```python
for interaction in past_interactions:
    prompt += f"User: {interaction['user']}\nBot: {interaction['bot']}\n"
```
- The AI includes previous user queries and its own responses to simulate memory.  

üîπ **Step 4: Processing the New User Query**  
```python
prompt += f"User: {user_input}\nBot:"
```
- The new question is appended so the AI can generate a response while considering past interactions.  

üîπ **Step 5: Generating AI Response**  
```python
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]
)
```
- The OpenAI API processes the prompt and generates a relevant response.  

üîπ **Step 6: Returning and Printing the Response**  
```python
return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```
- The AI‚Äôs response is extracted and displayed.

# üß† Understanding Procedural Memory in AI and Humans

Procedural memory plays a crucial role in both humans and AI agents, allowing them to remember *how* to perform tasks rather than recalling specific past experiences. In this guide, we will break down procedural memory in an easy-to-understand way, provide real-world examples, and analyze how AI uses this concept, along with a **detailed explanation of code** for better understanding.

---

## üîç What is Procedural Memory?

Procedural memory is a type of **long-term memory** that helps in **remembering rules and processes** needed to perform tasks. Unlike **episodic memory**, which recalls specific experiences, procedural memory is about skills and habits.

### üèÜ **Examples in Humans**
- Learning how to **ride a bicycle** üèçÔ∏è
- Typing on a keyboard without looking ‚å®Ô∏è
- Playing a musical instrument üé∏
- Driving a car üöó

Once learned, these actions **become automatic**‚Äîwe don‚Äôt need to think about each step every time.

---

## ü§ñ Procedural Memory in AI Agents

For **AI agents**, procedural memory consists of:
1. **Model Weights** ‚Äì The trained knowledge stored in a machine learning model.
2. **Agent Code** ‚Äì The logic that controls how an agent behaves.
3. **Agent Prompt** ‚Äì The set of instructions or context guiding an AI model.

While **humans refine procedural memory** through repetition, AI can **modify its prompts dynamically** to improve performance.

---

## üîÑ How AI Updates Its Procedural Memory?

AI can **refine its behavior** using two main approaches:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Reflection (Meta-Prompting)**
Instead of modifying its **model weights** or **rewriting code**, an AI agent **updates its prompts** using user feedback. This technique helps improve responses dynamically.

#### üìå **Example: AI Tweet Generator**
Imagine an AI that summarizes research papers into tweets. Instead of manually refining prompts for every paper, we allow the AI to:
- **Generate a summary**
- **Receive user feedback**
- **Update its instructions** for better tweets

---

## üìù Implementing Procedural Memory in AI (Code Example)

Let‚Äôs look at a **Python example** of how an AI agent can modify its **instructions** dynamically using a **memory store**.

### üìå **Step 1: Calling the AI Model with Updated Instructions**
```python
# Node that *uses* the stored instructions
def call_model(state: State, store: BaseStore):
    namespace = ("agent_instructions", )  # Namespace for stored instructions
    instructions = store.get(namespace, key="agent_a")[0]  # Retrieve stored instructions
    
    # Format prompt with stored instructions
    prompt = prompt_template.format(instructions=instructions.value["instructions"])
    
    # AI model processes the prompt (Assuming a language model like OpenAI GPT)
    response = llm.invoke(prompt)  
    
    return response  # Return AI-generated response
```
#### üìå **Explanation:**
1. **Retrieve stored instructions**: The agent fetches previously saved prompts.
2. **Format the prompt**: It injects these instructions into the AI model.
3. **Invoke the AI model**: It generates a response based on the refined prompt.

---

### üìå **Step 2: Updating the Instructions Based on Feedback**
```python
# Node that updates the stored instructions based on feedback
def update_instructions(state: State, store: BaseStore):
    namespace = ("instructions", )  # Namespace for instructions
    current_instructions = store.search(namespace)[0]  # Retrieve current instructions
    
    # Create a prompt combining past instructions and new conversation history
    prompt = prompt_template.format(instructions=current_instructions.value["instructions"], conversation=state["messages"])
    
    # AI model generates improved instructions
    output = llm.invoke(prompt)
    new_instructions = output['new_instructions']
    
    # Save the updated instructions back to the store
    store.put(("agent_instructions", ), "agent_a", {"instructions": new_instructions})
```
#### üìå **Explanation:**
1. **Retrieve the current stored instructions.**
2. **Combine instructions with recent user messages** to generate context-aware improvements.
3. **Generate a new set of instructions** using an AI model.
4. **Store the updated instructions** for future interactions.

---

## üîÑ Writing AI Memories: Hot Path vs. Background Processing

### ‚ö° **1. Writing Memories in the Hot Path**
- AI updates its **memory in real-time** during interactions.
- Useful for **instant learning**, but can increase processing time.
- **Example:** ChatGPT dynamically adjusting responses while chatting.

### ‚è≥ **2. Writing Memories in the Background**
- AI processes **past interactions in a background task** instead of real-time.
- Avoids slowing down main operations.
- **Example:** AI reviewing past conversations overnight to improve future responses.

**üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Example:**
Imagine an **AI customer support bot**:
- *Hot Path Memory:* Learns common questions instantly but may slow down responses.
- *Background Memory:* Reviews conversations later to optimize answers without affecting live chats.

---

## üéØ Conclusion

Procedural memory in AI allows **agents to refine their behavior** dynamically, just like humans perfect skills through practice. Using **meta-prompting** and **feedback loops**, AI can improve **without retraining models**, making it **efficient and adaptable**.

### üöÄ **Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ Procedural memory stores **how to perform tasks** (rules, logic, habits).  
‚úÖ AI modifies its **prompts dynamically** instead of retraining models.  
‚úÖ Two ways to update AI memory: **Hot Path (real-time updates) & Background Processing** (scheduled updates).  
‚úÖ **Real-world use cases** include chatbots, recommendation systems, and AI-generated content.  

By leveraging procedural memory, **AI systems become smarter and more efficient**, continuously learning from interactions‚Äîjust like humans! üöÄüí°
