# üß© **Understanding Graph State vs Tool Calls in Multi-Agent Systems**  

When designing multi-agent systems, one of the key considerations is **how agents communicate**. There are two primary approaches:  

1. **Graph State Communication** (agents share state updates directly)  
2. **Tool Calls** (agents call specific tools to perform tasks and pass arguments)  

Let's explore these in detail with **real-world examples, code snippets, and explanations** to make the concept clear.

## üî∑ **What is Graph State?**  
In **Graph State Communication**, agents communicate by passing around a **shared state**. Each agent updates this state before passing it to the next agent in the system.  

### üìå **How it Works:**  
- Each agent is a **node in the graph**.  
- The **state is passed from node to node**, with updates applied at each step.  
- Agents may **share a common state schema** or have their own **private state schemas**.  

### üè¢ **Real-World Example: Workflow Automation System**  
Imagine a **document approval process** in a company:  
1. **Employee submits a request** ‚Üí Document is sent to a Supervisor.  
2. **Supervisor reviews and approves/rejects** ‚Üí If approved, it goes to HR.  
3. **HR processes the document** ‚Üí Updates company records.  

Each step modifies the **shared state** (document status, comments, approvals) and passes it forward.  

---

## üõ† **Graph State Communication in LangGraph (Code Example)**  
Let's define a **graph-based system** where agents communicate via state.  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Defining the State Schema**  
We define a `MessagesState` class, which holds the messages exchanged between agents.  

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END
from langgraph.types import Command

model = ChatOpenAI()

# Define state schema (shared between agents)
class CustomState(MessagesState):
    next: str  # Defines which agent to call next
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing the Agents**  
Each agent updates the **shared state** before passing it to the next agent.  

```python
def agent_1(state: CustomState) -> Command[str]:
    """Agent 1 processes input and decides the next step."""
    response = model.invoke({"input": state.messages})  # Simulate AI processing
    return Command(goto="agent_2", update={"messages": [response]})

def agent_2(state: CustomState) -> Command[str]:
    """Agent 2 receives updated state and processes further."""
    response = model.invoke({"input": state.messages})
    return Command(goto="agent_3", update={"messages": [response]})

def agent_3(state: CustomState) -> Command[str]:
    """Final agent processes the final response and completes the workflow."""
    response = model.invoke({"input": state.messages})
    return Command(goto=END, update={"messages": [response]})
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Constructing the Workflow Graph**  
We define a **graph of nodes** that determines the flow of execution.  

```python
# Build the workflow graph
builder = StateGraph(CustomState)

# Add agents as nodes
builder.add_node(agent_1)
builder.add_node(agent_2)
builder.add_node(agent_3)

# Define flow between nodes
builder.add_edge(START, "agent_1")
builder.add_edge("agent_1", "agent_2")
builder.add_edge("agent_2", "agent_3")
builder.add_edge("agent_3", END)

# Compile the graph
workflow_graph = builder.compile()
```

### ‚úÖ **What Happens Here?**
1. **Agent 1** processes input and updates the state.  
2. **Agent 2** gets the updated state and continues processing.  
3. **Agent 3** completes the workflow and ends execution.  

This is an example of **deterministic, structured communication**.

## üî∂ **What are Tool Calls?**
In **Tool Calls Communication**, instead of sharing state directly, agents use **function calls (tools)** to perform tasks.  

### üìå **How it Works:**  
- A **supervisor agent** decides which tools to call.  
- Each tool takes **specific inputs**, performs a task, and returns results.  
- The **supervisor dynamically determines execution order** based on the inputs.  

### üöó **Real-World Example: AI-Powered Customer Support**  
Consider an **AI-based customer service chatbot**:  
1. User asks a question.  
2. The AI determines which tool to use:  
   - **FAQ Lookup Tool** (if it's a common question)  
   - **Ticket Creation Tool** (if it requires human support)  
   - **Billing Inquiry Tool** (if it's a payment issue)  
3. The AI calls the selected tool and returns a response.  

---

## üõ† **Tool Calls in LangGraph (Code Example)**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Defining the Supervisor**
The **supervisor** decides which tool (agent) to call.  

```python
def supervisor(state: MessagesState) -> Command[str]:
    """Decides which tool (agent) to call based on user input."""
    response = model.invoke({"input": state.messages})
    
    # Example decision-making based on response type
    if "billing" in response:
        return Command(goto="billing_tool")
    elif "support" in response:
        return Command(goto="support_tool")
    else:
        return Command(goto=END)
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing the Tools**
Each **tool performs a specific task** and returns results.  

```python
def billing_tool(state: MessagesState) -> Command[str]:
    """Handles billing-related inquiries."""
    response = model.invoke({"input": state.messages})
    return Command(goto="supervisor", update={"messages": [response]})

def support_tool(state: MessagesState) -> Command[str]:
    """Handles technical support inquiries."""
    response = model.invoke({"input": state.messages})
    return Command(goto="supervisor", update={"messages": [response]})
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Constructing the Tool-Based Workflow**
```python
# Build the graph
builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Add supervisor and tools as nodes
builder.add_node(supervisor)
builder.add_node("billing_tool", billing_tool)
builder.add_node("support_tool", support_tool)

# Define flow between nodes
builder.add_edge(START, "supervisor")
builder.add_edge("billing_tool", "supervisor")
builder.add_edge("support_tool", "supervisor")

# Compile the graph
tool_graph = builder.compile()
```

### ‚úÖ **What Happens Here?**
1. The **supervisor** decides which tool to call.  
2. The selected **tool processes the request**.  
3. The tool **returns results** to the supervisor for further decisions.  

This is an example of **dynamic execution**, where the **flow is determined at runtime**.

## üî• **Graph State vs Tool Calls: When to Use What?**
| Feature | Graph State | Tool Calls |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **Best for** | Structured workflows | Dynamic decision-making |
| **Execution flow** | Predefined | Decided at runtime |
| **Communication** | Shared state | Function calls |
| **Scalability** | Can become complex with many agents | Easier to scale dynamically |

---

## üéØ **Key Takeaways**
- **Graph State**: Best for structured workflows where agents follow a predefined sequence.  
- **Tool Calls**: Best for dynamic decision-making where the supervisor picks the next tool to call.  
- **Hybrid Approach**: You can **combine both approaches**, using a **supervisor to manage a structured graph of agents**.  

### üöÄ **Next Steps**
- Try **modifying the code** to handle different workflows.  
- Implement a **hybrid model** where some agents use **state-based communication**, and others use **tool calls**.  
- Explore **memory management strategies** for handling **large-scale agent networks**.
