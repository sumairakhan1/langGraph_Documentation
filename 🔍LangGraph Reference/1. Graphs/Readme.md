# 🌐 Understanding Graph Functions in Python

Graphs are a fundamental data structure used in various applications, from network routing to decision trees. The functions described here are part of a framework that helps in managing the flow between different nodes in a graph. Let’s break them down one by one with **detailed explanations, real-world use cases, alternative examples, and code samples** to ensure a solid understanding.

---

## 🔹 1. `add_conditional_edges(source, path, path_map=None, then=None)`

### ✅ **Purpose**:
This function **adds conditional edges** between nodes. A graph consists of nodes (points) and edges (connections). This method dynamically decides the next node(s) based on conditions.

### 🛠 **How It Works**:
- **`source (str)`**: The node from where the transition starts.
- **`path (callable function)`**: A function that determines the next node(s) based on conditions.
- **`path_map (optional)`**: A dictionary or list that maps paths to specific node names.
- **`then (optional)`**: A node that will always execute after the selected path.

### 🎯 **Real-World Use Case**:
Imagine a **chatbot** where a user is asked a question:
- If they respond with "Yes," they move to the "confirmation" node.
- If they say "No," they go to the "alternative_suggestion" node.

### 💻 **Code Example**:
```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = {}

    def add_conditional_edges(self, source, path, path_map=None, then=None):
        """Adds a conditional edge in the graph."""
        self.edges[source] = {"path": path, "path_map": path_map, "then": then}
        return self  # Returning self allows method chaining

# Example usage
def decide_next_node(user_response):
    return "confirmation" if user_response.lower() == "yes" else "alternative_suggestion"

graph = Graph()
graph.add_conditional_edges("question_asked", decide_next_node)
```

### 🔄 **Alternative Examples**:
1. **Login System Navigation**  
   - "Enter password" → If correct, go to "dashboard"; otherwise, go to "forgot_password."
2. **E-commerce Checkout**  
   - "Cart" → If "Apply Discount" clicked, go to "discount_applied"; otherwise, go to "payment."
3. **Banking Transactions**  
   - "Withdraw Money" → If balance is sufficient, go to "success"; otherwise, go to "insufficient_funds."

---

## 🔹 2. `set_entry_point(key)`

### ✅ **Purpose**:
Defines **the first node** to be executed in the graph. Without an entry point, the graph does not know where to start.

### 🛠 **How It Works**:
- **`key (str)`**: Specifies the starting node.

### 🎯 **Real-World Use Case**:
Think of an **online application form**:
- The first step is always "User Registration."
- After this, users proceed to the next steps dynamically.

### 💻 **Code Example**:
```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.entry_point = None

    def set_entry_point(self, key):
        """Sets the entry point of the graph."""
        self.entry_point = key
        return self  # Allowing method chaining

graph = Graph()
graph.set_entry_point("User Registration")
print(graph.entry_point)  # Output: User Registration
```

### 🔄 **Alternative Examples**:
1. **Traffic Light System**  
   - The process always starts at "Red Light."
2. **AI Model Pipeline**  
   - The first step is always "Data Preprocessing."
3. **Game Levels**  
   - The first level in a game is "Tutorial."

---

## 🔹 3. `set_conditional_entry_point(path, path_map=None, then=None)`

### ✅ **Purpose**:
Defines **a dynamic entry point** based on a condition. Unlike `set_entry_point`, which is static, this function **chooses the starting node dynamically**.

### 🛠 **How It Works**:
- **`path (callable function)`**: A function that determines the initial node.
- **`path_map (optional)`**: Maps conditions to node names.
- **`then (optional)`**: A node to execute after the selected entry point.

### 🎯 **Real-World Use Case**:
Imagine a **survey system**:
- If a user is a "new customer," start with "Welcome Guide."
- If they are a "returning customer," start with "Account Overview."

### 💻 **Code Example**:
```python
def determine_start(user_type):
    return "Welcome Guide" if user_type == "new" else "Account Overview"

graph = Graph()
graph.set_conditional_entry_point(determine_start)

# Simulating user types
print(graph.entry_point("new"))  # Output: Welcome Guide
print(graph.entry_point("existing"))  # Output: Account Overview
```

### 🔄 **Alternative Examples**:
1. **Online Exams**  
   - If a student is a beginner, start with "Easy Questions"; otherwise, start with "Advanced Questions."
2. **Customer Support Flow**  
   - If a customer has a "billing issue," start with "Billing Support"; otherwise, start with "Technical Support."
3. **Online Course Enrollment**  
   - If a student has prior experience, start from "Advanced Topics"; otherwise, start from "Basic Concepts."

---

## 🔹 4. `set_finish_point(key)`

### ✅ **Purpose**:
Marks a **node as the final step**. Once this node is reached, the graph stops execution.

### 🛠 **How It Works**:
- **`key (str)`**: Specifies the stopping point.

### 🎯 **Real-World Use Case**:
Think of **an interview process**:
- A candidate must go through "Technical Round," then "HR Round."
- If they pass both, they reach "Final Selection."

### 💻 **Code Example**:
```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.finish_point = None

    def set_finish_point(self, key):
        """Marks a node as the finish point."""
        self.finish_point = key
        return self  # Allowing method chaining

graph = Graph()
graph.set_finish_point("Final Selection")
print(graph.finish_point)  # Output: Final Selection
```

### 🔄 **Alternative Examples**:
1. **E-commerce Checkout Flow**  
   - The final step is "Order Confirmation."
2. **Movie Streaming App**  
   - The last step in user onboarding is "Subscription Confirmation."
3. **Medical Diagnosis System**  
   - After all tests, the last step is "Final Report."

# 🚀 Understanding `StateGraph` in `langgraph`
A **`StateGraph`** is a type of graph where nodes communicate by modifying a shared state. Each node in the graph processes information, updates the state, and passes it to the next node. This is useful in workflows, automation, and AI pipelines where different steps depend on shared data.

## 📌 **Key Concepts**
1. **Nodes** ➝ Functions that process state and pass it forward.
2. **State** ➝ A shared dictionary-like object storing values.
3. **Reducers** ➝ Functions that combine state values from multiple nodes.
4. **Edges** ➝ Define the flow between nodes.
5. **Entry & Finish Points** ➝ Define where execution starts and stops.

---

# 🔥 **1. Creating a `StateGraph`**
A `StateGraph` is a specialized graph where nodes modify a **shared state** instead of just passing messages. 

### ✅ **Example: Counting Numbers**
Let’s create a basic `StateGraph` that:
1. Starts with `x = 1`
2. Increments `x`
3. Stops execution when `x >= 3`

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

# Define a simple function that increments x
def increment_node(state, config):
    return {"x": state["x"] + 1}

# Create a state graph with an initial dictionary as state
graph = StateGraph(dict)

# Add our function as a node
graph.add_node("increment", increment_node)

# Set entry and finish points
graph.set_entry_point("increment")
graph.set_finish_point("increment")

# Compile and execute the graph
compiled = graph.compile()
output = compiled.invoke({"x": 1})  # Start with x = 1
print(output)  # Expected Output: {'x': 2}
```

✅ **Real-World Use Case**: 
- Automated workflows where different tasks update a shared state (e.g., approval processes in HR systems).

---

# ⚙️ **2. Using Reducers**
A **reducer function** helps aggregate state values when multiple nodes modify the same key.

### ✅ **Example: Collecting User Inputs**
We want to collect multiple numbers in a list.

```python
from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict

# Define a reducer function
def reducer(a: list, b: int | None) -> list:
    if b is not None:
        return a + [b]
    return a

# Define State with Reducer
class State(TypedDict):
    numbers: Annotated[list, reducer]

# Create the Graph
graph = StateGraph(State)

# Node that adds a number
def add_number(state, config):
    return {"numbers": 10}

graph.add_node("add_number", add_number)
graph.set_entry_point("add_number")
graph.set_finish_point("add_number")

compiled = graph.compile()
output = compiled.invoke({"numbers": []})
print(output)  # Expected Output: {'numbers': [10]}
```

✅ **Real-World Use Case**:
- Aggregating values from multiple sources (e.g., collecting votes in an online poll).

---

# 🌟 **3. Conditional Edges**
Sometimes, we want different paths depending on the state.

### ✅ **Example: Decision Making**
A node will decide whether to approve or reject based on a score.

```python
def decision_node(state, config):
    if state["score"] >= 50:
        return "approve"
    return "reject"

graph = StateGraph(dict)
graph.add_node("decision", decision_node)

# Define edges based on output
graph.add_conditional_edges("decision", decision_node, path_map={"approve": "approved", "reject": "rejected"})

graph.set_entry_point("decision")
graph.set_finish_point("approved")
graph.set_finish_point("rejected")

compiled = graph.compile()
output = compiled.invoke({"score": 60})
print(output)  # Will go to "approved"
```

✅ **Real-World Use Case**:
- Loan approval systems (e.g., checking a credit score to decide whether to approve a loan).

---

# 🔄 **4. Setting Entry & Finish Points**
Every graph needs a **starting point** and a **stopping condition**.

### ✅ **Example: Multiplication Process**
```python
def multiply_node(state, config):
    return {"x": state["x"] * 2}

graph = StateGraph(dict)
graph.add_node("multiply", multiply_node)
graph.set_entry_point("multiply")
graph.set_finish_point("multiply")

compiled = graph.compile()
output = compiled.invoke({"x": 2})
print(output)  # Expected Output: {'x': 4}
```

✅ **Real-World Use Case**:
- Manufacturing automation where each machine doubles production.

---

# 🔗 **5. Adding Nodes and Edges**
### ✅ **Example: Workflow with Two Steps**
```python
def step1(state, config):
    return {"x": state["x"] + 1}

def step2(state, config):
    return {"x": state["x"] * 2}

graph = StateGraph(dict)
graph.add_node("step1", step1)
graph.add_node("step2", step2)

# Define flow between nodes
graph.add_edge("step1", "step2")

graph.set_entry_point("step1")
graph.set_finish_point("step2")

compiled = graph.compile()
output = compiled.invoke({"x": 1})
print(output)  # Expected Output: {'x': 4} (1+1 → 2*2 = 4)
```

✅ **Real-World Use Case**:
- AI pipelines where data passes through multiple transformations.

---

# 🚀 **Summary & Key Takeaways**
✅ **`StateGraph`** allows multiple nodes to process a shared state.  
✅ **Reducers** help combine values from multiple nodes.  
✅ **Conditional edges** allow dynamic flow changes.  
✅ **Entry & finish points** define start and stop conditions.  
✅ **Real-world applications**: AI workflows, automation, approval systems, IoT, etc.

I'll break this down into **several sections with detailed explanations**, covering:
- **What is CompiledStateGraph?**
- **Explanation of Each Attribute**
- **Methods and Their Uses**
- **Alternative Examples**
- **Real-World Use Cases**
- **Code Examples**

---

# 🔍 **What is CompiledStateGraph?**
A **CompiledStateGraph** is a **compiled representation of a computational graph** where each node represents a function, and the edges define dependencies between computations. 

It is **useful for managing data flow, dependencies, and state transitions** within a structured workflow.

## ✅ **Where is it Used?**
It is used in **stateful computations** where intermediate results need to be stored and updated dynamically, such as:
1. **Data Pipelines** (Machine Learning, ETL processes)
2. **Automated Workflows** (e.g., CI/CD pipelines)
3. **Streaming Applications** (e.g., real-time data processing)

---

# 🛠 **Explanation of Attributes**
Let's break down each attribute and explain its purpose.

## 🔹 `stream_mode: StreamMode`
- **What it does**: Defines how data is streamed through the computation graph.
- **Default**: `"values"` (outputs all values after each step).
- **Alternative Values**:
  - `"updates"` → Emits only updates.
  - `"custom"` → Emits custom data.
  - `"messages"` → Streams LLM messages.
  - `"debug"` → Provides debug information.

**🔹 Example Usage**:
```python
graph.stream(input_data, stream_mode="updates")
```
- This ensures only the updated values are streamed.

---

## 🔹 `stream_eager: bool`
- **What it does**: Forces streaming events to be emitted immediately.
- **Automatically enabled for**:
  - `"messages"` mode
  - `"custom"` mode

**🔹 Example Usage**:
```python
graph.stream(input_data, stream_eager=True)
```
- Ensures outputs are streamed without waiting for completion.

---

## 🔹 `stream_channels: Optional[Union[str, Sequence[str]]]`
- **What it does**: Specifies which channels should receive streamed output.
- **Default**: Streams to all available channels **except reserved ones**.

**🔹 Example Usage**:
```python
graph.stream(input_data, stream_channels=["channel_1", "channel_2"])
```
- This restricts output streaming to only the specified channels.

---

## 🔹 `step_timeout: Optional[float]`
- **What it does**: Sets a maximum time (in seconds) for a step to complete.
- **Default**: `None` (no timeout).
- **Useful for**:

## 📚 Final Code Example

Here’s an integrated example that sets up a simple state graph, compiles it into a `CompiledStateGraph`, and demonstrates streaming with different modes:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage

# Define a simple state schema using a dictionary
class State(dict):
    pass

# Create a state graph
builder = StateGraph(State)

# Add a node that simulates a chat response
def chatbot_node(state, config):
    # Simulate a chatbot response
    response = "Hello! How can I help you?"
    return {"messages": [AIMessage(content=response, id="msg1")]}

builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
builder.set_entry_point("chatbot")
builder.set_finish_point("chatbot")

# Compile the graph into a CompiledStateGraph
compiled_graph = builder.compile()

# Example: Synchronous invocation with streaming (values mode)
result = compiled_graph.invoke({"messages": []}, stream_mode="values")
print("Final Result:", result)

# Example: Streaming using asynchronous iterator (debug mode)
import asyncio
async def stream_async():
    async for event in compiled_graph.astream({"messages": []}, stream_mode="debug"):
        print("Stream Event:", event)
