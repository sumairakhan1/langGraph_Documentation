# ⏳ Time Travel in LangGraph: Debugging and Human-in-the-Loop Interaction  

Time travel in LangGraph is a powerful debugging and control feature that allows users to **view, replay, and even fork from past states** of a process. This is particularly useful in scenarios where we need **human approval, debugging, and state editing**.  

---  

## 🏆 **Why Do We Need Time Travel?**  

### ✅ **1. Approval**  
- Allows human users to **review and approve actions** before they are executed.  
- **Example:** A finance application where transactions require human approval before processing.  

### 🔍 **2. Debugging**  
- Enables developers to **rewind the execution graph** to reproduce or avoid issues.  
- **Example:** In an AI chatbot system, we might want to go back and check why a certain incorrect response was generated.  

### ✏️ **3. Editing**  
- Users can **modify the state** of an execution process when needed.  
- **Example:** A workflow automation system where a user can update an approval status before proceeding to the next step.  

---

## 🚀 **Setting Up LangGraph for Time Travel**  

We start by installing and configuring **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and required libraries.  

### 📌 **Install Dependencies**  
```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_openai langgraph_sdk
```
🔹 `pip install` ensures all necessary libraries are installed.  

### 🔑 **Setting Up API Keys**  
We use OpenAI's API for processing. The `_set_env` function securely stores our API key.  

```python
import os, getpass

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```
🔹 **`getpass.getpass()`** prompts the user to enter their API key securely.  

---

## 🤖 **Building an AI-Powered Arithmetic Agent**  

### ✨ **Defining Arithmetic Functions**  
We define simple arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, and division) as tools that the AI agent can use.  

```python
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Multiply two numbers."""
    return a * b

def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers."""
    return a + b

def divide(a: int, b: int) -> float:
    """Divide two numbers."""
    return a / b
```
🔹 Each function **performs an arithmetic operation** and returns the result.  
🔹 These functions will later be bound to the AI model as tools.  

---

## 🛠️ **Integrating the AI Model with Tools**  

We integrate our AI model (`gpt-4o`) and bind our arithmetic tools to it.  

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

tools = [add, multiply, divide]
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)
```
🔹 **`ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")`** loads the OpenAI GPT-4o model.  
🔹 **`bind_tools(tools)`** allows the AI to use our arithmetic functions dynamically.  

---

## 🌐 **Building the Execution Graph**  

We create a **message processing system** that dynamically routes messages between AI and tools.  

### 🔹 **Defining Messages and System Instructions**  
```python
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage

sys_msg = SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant tasked with performing arithmetic on a set of inputs.")
```
🔹 The **system message** provides instructions to the AI about its role.  

---

### 📍 **Defining Graph Nodes (Processing Units)**  
A **node** is where computation happens. We define two main nodes:  
1. **`assistant` Node** – The AI processes messages.  
2. **`tools` Node** – The AI invokes the appropriate arithmetic function.  

```python
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState

def assistant(state: MessagesState):
   return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke([sys_msg] + state["messages"])]}
```
🔹 The `assistant` function **invokes the AI model with system and user messages**.  
🔹 If the AI needs to perform a calculation, it will call one of our arithmetic tools.  

---

### 🔄 **Defining the Execution Flow**  
We define a **state graph** that controls how messages flow between nodes.  

```python
from langgraph.graph import START, END, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition, ToolNode

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define Nodes
builder.add_node("assistant", assistant)
builder.add_node("tools", ToolNode(tools))

# Define Edges (Flow Logic)
builder.add_edge(START, "assistant")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "assistant",
    tools_condition,  # Decides whether to go to tools or end execution
)
builder.add_edge("tools", "assistant")
```
🔹 **Edges define the flow of execution:**  
  - The process **starts at `assistant`**.  
  - If AI **detects a tool call**, it **routes the request to the `tools` node**.  
  - The **result returns to `assistant`** for further processing.  
  - The process **ends if no tool call is required**.  

---

## ⏳ **Enabling Time Travel for Debugging**  

To enable **time travel (replaying past states, debugging, and modifications)**, we use **MemorySaver** for state checkpoints.  

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver())
```
🔹 **`MemorySaver()`** allows us to save, rewind, and fork execution states.  

---

## 🖼️ **Visualizing the Graph**  

We generate a **graph visualization** of our AI-powered workflow.  

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))
```
🔹 **The graph visualization helps in debugging** by showing how messages flow between nodes.  

---

## 🎯 **Real-World Applications of Time Travel in AI Systems**  

1️⃣ **🛒 E-Commerce Chatbots**  
   - AI-powered assistants can **recall past conversations** to refine responses.  
   - Time travel helps debug why a chatbot **recommended the wrong product**.  

2️⃣ **📑 Workflow Automation**  
   - Businesses can **rewind and modify** workflow execution if an error is found.  
   - Example: An automated approval system that **lets a manager modify a decision** before finalizing.  

3️⃣ **🧠 AI Debugging and Fine-Tuning**  
   - Time travel allows developers to **track model decisions** and improve accuracy.  
   - Example: A **medical AI assistant** that suggests treatments based on patient history.

# 🔀 **Understanding Forking in Graph-Based Systems**

## 📌 **Introduction**
Forking is a powerful concept in graph-based workflows that allows you to take a previous state, modify it, and create a new execution path. This is especially useful when you want to explore alternative scenarios, rerun a process with different inputs, or debug an AI agent.

In this guide, we’ll cover:
- **What is forking?**
- **How does forking work in a computational graph?**
- **Real-world use cases of forking**
- **Step-by-step explanation of forking with code examples**
- **Alternative approaches to achieve similar results**

---

## 🔄 **What is Forking?**
Forking means taking a previous checkpoint (a saved state of a process) and modifying it to create a new branch of execution. The original state remains unchanged, while the new state follows a different path.

Think of it like:
- **Version control (Git branches):** You start from a previous commit, modify the code, and test a new feature without affecting the main branch.
- **Video games (Save states):** If you reach a difficult level, you can save the game, try different strategies, and reload if needed.

---

## 🎯 **Real-World Use Cases of Forking**
1. **AI Chatbot Debugging:** If an AI assistant gives an unexpected response, you can fork the conversation at a specific point, modify the user input, and test different replies.
2. **Financial Simulations:** If a stock prediction model gives a certain forecast, analysts can modify input parameters and test alternative economic scenarios.
3. **Scientific Experiments:** Researchers can tweak variables in simulation software and observe how changes affect results.
4. **Automated Testing:** Software engineers can fork test cases with different parameters and check if an application behaves correctly in all scenarios.

---

## 🏗️ **How Forking Works in a Graph-Based System**
1. **Retrieve a previous state** from the system.
2. **Modify the state** by changing the input values or parameters.
3. **Create a new checkpoint** that maintains history but follows a different path.
4. **Execute the new state** and analyze results.

---

## 📝 **Step-by-Step Code Explanation**
Let’s go through the forking process using Python-like pseudo-code.

### **1️⃣ Retrieve a Previous State**
We want to get a specific past state from the graph.

```python
to_fork = all_states[-2]  # Get the second-last state
print(to_fork.values["messages"])
```

🔍 **Explanation:**
- `all_states` stores all previous states.
- `[-2]` selects the second-last state.
- `.values["messages"]` retrieves the messages at this state.

### **2️⃣ View Configuration of the State**
Before modifying, let's check its configuration.

```python
print(to_fork.config)
```

🔍 **Explanation:**
- The `config` contains metadata like thread ID and checkpoint ID.
- This helps ensure we are modifying the correct execution step.

### **3️⃣ Modify the State (Create Fork)**
We update the message in the state to test a new scenario.

```python
fork_config = graph.update_state(
    to_fork.config,
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content='Multiply 5 and 3', 
                               id=to_fork.values["messages"][0].id)]},
)
```

🔍 **Explanation:**
- `graph.update_state(...)` modifies the state at the checkpoint.
- `to_fork.config` tells the graph where the state belongs.
- `"messages": [HumanMessage(...)]` replaces the existing message.
- `id=to_fork.values["messages"][0].id` ensures we overwrite instead of appending.

### **4️⃣ View the Updated Forked State**
Check if the new state has been properly created.

```python
print(fork_config)
```

🔍 **Explanation:**
- `fork_config` now contains the new checkpoint ID.
- This allows the system to recognize that a fork has been made.

### **5️⃣ Execute the Forked State**
Now that we have modified the state, let's execute it.

```python
for event in graph.stream(None, fork_config, stream_mode="values"):
    event['messages'][-1].pretty_print()
```

🔍 **Explanation:**
- `graph.stream(...)` starts processing from the new state.
- `"values"` mode ensures we get the output messages.
- `event['messages'][-1].pretty_print()` displays the result.

### **📌 Expected Output**
```
================================ Human Message =================================
Multiply 5 and 3
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  multiply (call_KP2CVNMMUKMJAQuFmamHB21r)
 Call ID: call_KP2CVNMMUKMJAQuFmamHB21r
  Args:
    a: 5
    b: 3
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: multiply
15
================================== Ai Message ==================================
The result of multiplying 5 and 3 is 15.
```

---

## 🎭 **Alternative Approaches**
### 🔹 **1. Cloning Instead of Forking**
Instead of modifying an existing state, you can create an independent copy.

```python
new_config = graph.clone_state(to_fork.config)
graph.update_state(new_config, {"messages": [HumanMessage(content='Multiply 4 and 6')]})
```

📌 **Use Case:** If you want a fresh start without modifying history.

---

### 🔹 **2. Using Parameterized Execution**
Instead of modifying states manually, pass different parameters dynamically.

```python
def execute_with_different_inputs(a, b):
    return graph.execute({"messages": [HumanMessage(content=f"Multiply {a} and {b}")]})

execute_with_different_inputs(7, 2)
```

📌 **Use Case:** If you want to test multiple scenarios without storing states.

---

### 🔹 **3. Using Version Control for States**
Instead of forking within a graph, maintain checkpoints using a database.

```python
db.save_checkpoint(state_id="step_3", data=current_state)
db.load_checkpoint("step_3")
```

📌 **Use Case:** If your system needs to persist states for long-term storage.

---

## 🚀 **Conclusion**
Forking is a **powerful technique** for:
✔️ Testing **alternative scenarios**  
✔️ Debugging **AI conversations**  
✔️ Simulating **"what-if" situations**  
✔️ Enhancing **automated testing**  

### **💡 Key Takeaways**
✅ **Forking helps you modify past states and test new scenarios.**  
✅ **It's commonly used in AI, finance, and research applications.**  
✅ **You can achieve similar results using cloning, parameterized execution, or version control.**  

🔹 **Next Steps:** Try implementing forking in your own projects to better understand its potential!

LangGraph is an API that allows you to create **graph-based workflows** for AI-powered applications. One of its key features is **"Time Travel,"** which lets you **replay, modify, and debug past states** of your workflow.  

### 🏆 **Real-World Example of Time Travel in AI**  
Let's say you are building an **AI-powered chatbot for customer service**. A user asks a question, and the chatbot responds. But what if you want to:  

✔️ **Replay the chatbot's decision-making process?**  
✔️ **Modify the chatbot's past responses?**  
✔️ **Test different scenarios without starting from scratch?**  

LangGraph’s **Time Travel API** allows you to **go back to a previous state, edit it, and replay** from that point—just like rewinding a movie! 🎥

## 📌 **Key Features of Time Travel in LangGraph API**  
1. **Replaying Past States:** Re-run a previous step in the conversation.  
2. **Streaming Updates:** Get real-time updates on changes in the conversation flow.  
3. **Forking a State:** Modify past messages and continue from a modified point.

# 🛠️ **Setting Up LangGraph API**
Before we start coding, let's check the system requirements.  

```python
import platform

if 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython()) or platform.system() != 'Darwin':
    raise Exception("Unfortunately, LangGraph Studio is currently not supported on Google Colab or requires a Mac.")
```

### 🔍 **What This Code Does**  
✔️ **Checks if the code is running on Google Colab** or **a non-Mac system.**  
✔️ If yes, it raises an **exception** because LangGraph Studio requires macOS.  

---

# 📡 **Connecting to LangGraph API**
Once we confirm that the system is compatible, we connect to the LangGraph API.  

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client(url="http://localhost:62780")
```

### 🔍 **What This Code Does**  
✔️ Imports `get_client` from LangGraph SDK.  
✔️ Creates a `client` object that connects to **LangGraph Studio running locally** on port `62780`.  

---

# ⏪ **Replaying a Past State**
Now, let's **send a request to our AI assistant** and **track the process.**  

### 🔵 **Step 1: Create an AI Conversation Thread**  
```python
initial_input = {"messages": HumanMessage(content="Multiply 2 and 3")}
thread = await client.threads.create()
```

### 🔍 **What This Code Does**  
✔️ **Creates a new thread** (conversation).  
✔️ Sends a **message** asking the AI assistant to **multiply 2 and 3**.  

---

### 🔵 **Step 2: Stream the Conversation Updates**  
```python
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id="agent",
    input=initial_input,
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    if chunk.data:
        assistant_node = chunk.data.get('assistant', {}).get('messages', [])
        tool_node = chunk.data.get('tools', {}).get('messages', [])
        if assistant_node:
            print("-" * 20 + " Assistant Node " + "-" * 20)
            print(assistant_node[-1])
        elif tool_node:
            print("-" * 20 + " Tools Node " + "-" * 20)
            print(tool_node[-1])
```

### 🔍 **What This Code Does**  
✔️ **Streams real-time updates** of the assistant’s actions.  
✔️ **Displays AI’s response** (Assistant Node).  
✔️ **Shows tool execution results** (Tools Node).  

---

# 🔄 **Replaying from a Checkpoint**
Sometimes, we may need to **replay from a specific point** in the conversation.  

### 🔵 **Step 1: Retrieve Conversation History**  
```python
states = await client.threads.get_history(thread['thread_id'])
to_replay = states[-2]  # Get the second-last state
```

### 🔍 **What This Code Does**  
✔️ Retrieves the **entire chat history**.  
✔️ Stores the **second-last state** for replay.  

---

### 🔵 **Step 2: Replay from the Checkpoint**
```python
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id="agent",
    input=None,
    stream_mode="values",
    checkpoint_id=to_replay['checkpoint_id']
):      
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    print(chunk.data)
```

### 🔍 **What This Code Does**  
✔️ **Replays past conversation state** without re-executing everything.  
✔️ **Prints updates** of the conversation as it replays.  

---

# ✂️ **Forking and Editing a Past State**
What if we want to **modify a past message** and continue the conversation from there?  

### 🔵 **Step 1: Retrieve a Checkpoint**
```python
states = await client.threads.get_history(thread['thread_id'])
to_fork = states[-2]
to_fork['values']
```

### 🔍 **What This Code Does**  
✔️ Retrieves conversation history.  
✔️ Stores the second-last checkpoint for modification.  

---

### 🔵 **Step 2: Modify a Message**
```python
forked_input = {"messages": HumanMessage(content="Multiply 3 and 3",
                                         id=to_fork['values']['messages'][0]['id'])}

forked_config = await client.threads.update_state(
    thread["thread_id"],
    forked_input,
    checkpoint_id=to_fork['checkpoint_id']
)
```

### 🔍 **What This Code Does**  
✔️ **Edits the original message** from `"Multiply 2 and 3"` to `"Multiply 3 and 3"`.  
✔️ **Uses the same message ID** to overwrite the past message.  
✔️ **Updates the conversation state** with the new input.

# 🏆 **Alternative Examples**
### 🔹 **Example 1: Debugging a Customer Support Bot**  
A chatbot incorrectly understands a user's request. Instead of restarting the entire conversation, we **replay and modify** the incorrect response.  

### 🔹 **Example 2: AI-Powered Code Review**  
An AI-based code review tool flags an error. Instead of running the entire analysis again, we **replay from the error detection point** and make changes.  

### 🔹 **Example 3: Gaming AI Decision Trees**  
An AI-powered **game NPC (Non-Playable Character)** makes decisions using LangGraph. We use **time travel to replay AI actions** and tweak its behavior without restarting the game.

# 🏁 **Conclusion**
✔️ **LangGraph's Time Travel API** lets you replay, modify, and debug AI conversations efficiently.  
✔️ Useful for **chatbots, AI assistants, and debugging workflows.**  
✔️ Allows **real-time updates, forking, and replaying past states.**
