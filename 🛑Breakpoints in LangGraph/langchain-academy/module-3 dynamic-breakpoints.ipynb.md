# 🛑 **Dynamic Breakpoints in Graph Processing**  

Dynamic breakpoints allow a computational graph to **interrupt itself** based on internal logic instead of relying only on predefined developer-set breakpoints. This is useful in **human-in-the-loop** systems where approval, debugging, and editing of state are necessary.

---

## 🚀 **Why Do We Need Dynamic Breakpoints?**  

Dynamic breakpoints are helpful because they allow:  

1️⃣ **Conditional Interruption** – The graph can pause itself based on internal logic.  
2️⃣ **User Communication** – The reason for the interruption can be provided to the user.  
3️⃣ **State Modification** – Users can edit the state before resuming execution.

🔹 **Example Use Case:**  
A chatbot system that requires human review before responding to sensitive topics. If a flagged phrase is detected, the bot interrupts and asks for approval.

---

## 🔍 **Understanding Breakpoints in Graphs**  

### ✅ **Types of Breakpoints**  

Breakpoints can be:  
✔️ **Static** – Set by developers at specific nodes.  
✔️ **Dynamic** – Triggered based on logic inside the node.  

We achieve dynamic breakpoints using `NodeInterrupt`.

---

## 🛠 **Implementing Dynamic Breakpoints**  

### 📌 **Installation**  
We start by installing necessary dependencies:  

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_openai langgraph_sdk
```

🔹 **Why?**  
We need `langgraph`, `langchain_openai`, and `langgraph_sdk` to build and manage our computational graph.

---

## 🏗 **Building a Graph with Dynamic Breakpoints**  

### 📌 **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**  
```python
from IPython.display import Image, display
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.errors import NodeInterrupt
from langgraph.graph import START, END, StateGraph
```

🔹 **Why?**  
- `TypedDict` – Defines structured input/output for our graph.  
- `MemorySaver` – Allows saving the graph's state.  
- `NodeInterrupt` – Enables dynamic breakpoints.  
- `StateGraph` – Defines the computational graph.

---

### 📌 **Step 2: Define the State Structure**  
```python
class State(TypedDict):
    input: str
```

🔹 **Why?**  
This class ensures the graph nodes always receive data in a structured format.

---

### 📌 **Step 3: Create Graph Nodes**  
Each function represents a step in the computational graph.

#### 🟢 **Step 1: Initial Processing**  
```python
def step_1(state: State) -> State:
    print("---Step 1---")
    return state
```
✅ **What it does?**  
Simply prints a message and passes the state to the next step.

---

#### ⚠️ **Step 2: Dynamic Breakpoint (Interrupt on Condition)**  
```python
def step_2(state: State) -> State:
    if len(state['input']) > 5:
        raise NodeInterrupt(f"Received input that is longer than 5 characters: {state['input']}")
    print("---Step 2---")
    return state
```
✅ **What it does?**  
- If the input string has more than **5 characters**, execution is interrupted.  
- Otherwise, it moves to the next step.

---

#### 🟢 **Step 3: Final Processing**  
```python
def step_3(state: State) -> State:
    print("---Step 3---")
    return state
```
✅ **What it does?**  
Simply prints a message and completes the graph execution.

---

### 📌 **Step 4: Construct the Graph**  
```python
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)
```

✅ **What it does?**  
- Creates a graph with three nodes.  
- Connects them in sequence.

---

### 📌 **Step 5: Enable State Saving**  
```python
memory = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```
✅ **Why?**  
- `MemorySaver` stores the execution state so we can resume from breakpoints.

---

### 📌 **Step 6: Visualizing the Graph**  
```python
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```
✅ **Why?**  
- Generates a flowchart visualization of the graph.

---

## 🎯 **Testing the Graph with Dynamic Breakpoints**  

### 🛠 **Run the Graph with Long Input**  
```python
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```
✅ **Expected Output:**  
The execution **stops** at `step_2` because `"hello world"` has more than 5 characters.

---

### 🛠 **Check Current Execution State**  
```python
state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
print(state.next)  # ('step_2',)
```
✅ **Why?**  
- This tells us that execution stopped at `step_2`.

---

### 🛠 **Inspect Interrupt Message**  
```python
print(state.tasks)
```
✅ **Output:**  
A message indicating that execution was interrupted due to long input.

---

### 🔄 **Resuming Execution After Modifying State**  

Since we are stuck at `step_2`, we **modify the state** to have a shorter input.

```python
graph.update_state(
    thread_config,
    {"input": "hi"},
)
```
✅ **Why?**  
- This changes the input, allowing execution to continue.

---

### ▶️ **Resume Execution**  
```python
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```
✅ **Expected Output:**  
```
{'input': 'hi'}
---Step 2---
{'input': 'hi'}
---Step 3---
{'input': 'hi'}
```
🎯 **Success!** The graph resumes and completes execution.

---

## 📌 **Real-World Use Cases of Dynamic Breakpoints**  

🔹 **1. AI Chatbots** – If a response is flagged as inappropriate, execution is interrupted for human review.  
🔹 **2. Data Pipelines** – If incoming data does not meet validation rules, processing stops until the issue is fixed.  
🔹 **3. Workflow Automation** – If an approval step is required, the process halts until a user intervenes.  

---

## 🔥 **Key Takeaways**  

✔️ **Dynamic breakpoints let the graph interrupt itself conditionally.**  
✔️ **NodeInterrupt is used to trigger internal pauses.**  
✔️ **Graph execution can be resumed after modifying state.**  
✔️ **Useful in AI moderation, workflow automation, and debugging scenarios.**

# 🌐 **Usage with LangGraph API**  

This guide will walk you through using the LangGraph API via the SDK. We will explain each part of the code, its purpose, and how it all works together. We'll also discuss a real-world scenario where such functionality is useful.

---

## 🛠 **Overview**

LangGraph allows you to create and interact with computational graphs that can be executed, updated, and inspected. With the LangGraph API, you can:

- **Search** for hosted graphs (assistants).
- **Create threads** to run your graphs.
- **Stream** events from a graph execution.
- **Get and update state** during graph execution.

### 🎯 **Real-World Example**

Imagine an automated customer service chatbot system. Each conversation can be considered a thread in a graph. If the chatbot encounters an ambiguous or complex request, it might pause for human review (using dynamic breakpoints). Using the LangGraph API, you can:
- **Monitor the conversation state in real time.**
- **Update the conversation state** (e.g., change the customer's input or adjust the context) before the conversation continues.
- **Stream events** so that you can log or act upon each change.

---

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Code Explanation**

Below is the complete code example, along with detailed explanations for each line.

### 1. **Environment Check**

```python
import platform

# Check if the current environment is Google Colab or if the system is not macOS (Darwin)
if 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython()) or platform.system() != 'Darwin':
    raise Exception("Unfortunately LangGraph Studio is currently not supported on Google Colab or requires a Mac")
```

- **What it does:**  
  - Imports the `platform` module to check system information.
  - Uses `get_ipython()` to detect if the code is running in Google Colab.
  - Raises an exception if the code is executed on Google Colab or on any system that isn't macOS.
- **Why?**  
  - LangGraph Studio has compatibility requirements. This code ensures you are running in a supported environment.

---

### 2. **Connecting to the LangGraph API**

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

# Replace this with the URL of your own deployed graph
URL = "http://localhost:62575"
client = get_client(url=URL)
```

- **What it does:**  
  - Imports the `get_client` function from the LangGraph SDK.
  - Sets the URL of your LangGraph deployment (in this example, it’s running on `localhost`).
  - Creates a client instance to interact with the API.
- **Why?**  
  - The client serves as the interface for all subsequent API interactions (searching graphs, creating threads, etc.).

---

### 3. **Searching for Hosted Graphs and Creating a Thread**

```python
# Search all hosted graphs (assistants)
assistants = await client.assistants.search()

# Create a new thread for graph execution
thread = await client.threads.create()

# Prepare initial input for the graph
input_dict = {"input": "hello world"}
```

- **What it does:**  
  - `assistants = await client.assistants.search()`: Retrieves all available graphs hosted by the server.
  - `thread = await client.threads.create()`: Creates a new thread which represents a new instance or run of a graph.
  - `input_dict`: Defines the input that will be passed to the graph. Here, it contains the string `"hello world"`.
- **Why?**  
  - This section sets up your working environment by finding available graphs and creating a new execution instance (thread) with an initial input.

---

### 4. **Streaming Graph Execution Events**

```python
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id="dynamic_breakpoints",
    input=input_dict,
    stream_mode="values",
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    print(chunk.data)
    print("\n\n")
```

- **What it does:**  
  - Streams events from the graph execution using the `client.runs.stream` method.
  - **Parameters explained:**
    - `thread["thread_id"]`: The unique identifier of the thread created earlier.
    - `assistant_id="dynamic_breakpoints"`: Specifies the graph (assistant) to run. In this case, it's the one handling dynamic breakpoints.
    - `input=input_dict`: Passes the initial input to the graph.
    - `stream_mode="values"`: Sets the mode to receive value updates.
  - In the loop, each `chunk` represents an event (such as metadata or values) emitted by the running graph.
- **Why?**  
  - Streaming allows you to observe and log the progress of the graph execution in real time, which is especially useful for debugging and monitoring purposes.

---

### 5. **Inspecting the Current Graph State**

```python
current_state = await client.threads.get_state(thread['thread_id'])
print(current_state['next'])
```

- **What it does:**  
  - Retrieves the current state of the graph execution for the thread using `client.threads.get_state`.
  - Prints the next step in the graph (e.g., `['step_2']`).
- **Why?**  
  - By checking the state, you can determine where the graph is paused (e.g., at a dynamic breakpoint) and decide on further actions.

---

### 6. **Updating the Graph State**

```python
await client.threads.update_state(thread['thread_id'], {"input": "hi!"})
```

- **What it does:**  
  - Updates the state of the graph execution with new data. In this example, the input is changed to `"hi!"`.
- **Why?**  
  - If the graph was paused (e.g., due to an interrupt), updating the state can allow it to resume. This is similar to providing new input or modifying existing data to resolve an issue.

---

### 7. **Resuming Execution After State Update**

```python
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id="dynamic_breakpoints",
    input=None,
    stream_mode="values",
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    print(chunk.data)
    print("\n\n")
```

- **What it does:**  
  - Continues to stream events from the graph after the state has been updated.
  - Notice `input=None` is passed because we already updated the state; no new input is required.
- **Why?**  
  - This step resumes the graph execution, allowing you to see how the graph processes the updated state and eventually completes the execution.

---

### 8. **Checking the Final State**

```python
current_state = await client.threads.get_state(thread['thread_id'])
print(current_state)
```

- **What it does:**  
  - Retrieves and prints the complete current state of the thread after resuming execution.
- **Why?**  
  - Inspecting the final state confirms that the graph executed as expected and shows details such as:
    - The updated values.
    - The next step (if any).
    - Any tasks that have completed or been interrupted.
    - Metadata and checkpoint information.

---

## 🔥 **Key Takeaways**

- **Environment Checks:**  
  Ensure you are running the code in a supported environment (macOS and not Google Colab).

- **Client Connection:**  
  Establish a connection with the LangGraph server using the SDK.

- **Graph Execution:**  
  Create threads, provide initial inputs, and stream execution events in real time.

- **State Management:**  
  Get and update the state of the running graph, which is crucial for handling dynamic breakpoints and human-in-the-loop interventions.

- **Real-World Impact:**  
  Such an approach is invaluable for systems like customer support chatbots, where real-time monitoring and intervention are necessary to manage complex interactions.
