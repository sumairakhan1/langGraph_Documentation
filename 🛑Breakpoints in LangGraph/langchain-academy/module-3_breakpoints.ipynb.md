# 🔍 **Breakpoints in LangGraph: Human-in-the-Loop Debugging & Approval**

## 📌 **Introduction**
Breakpoints are a crucial concept in **human-in-the-loop AI workflows**, allowing us to **pause, review, and modify** an AI agent’s execution. This feature is particularly useful for:
- **Approval**: Users can approve or reject an AI-generated action before execution.
- **Debugging**: Developers can stop execution at key points to investigate issues.
- **Editing**: Users can modify the state of the AI before it proceeds.

LangGraph provides built-in mechanisms to introduce **breakpoints** in an execution graph. This guide will cover:
1. **Concept of breakpoints in AI workflows**
2. **Real-world applications**
3. **Implementation with code examples**
4. **Step-by-step breakdown of the code**

---

## 🎯 **Why Use Breakpoints?**
### 🔎 **1. Approval**
- AI can **request approval** before executing certain actions.
- Example: A **finance chatbot** asks for confirmation before making a bank transfer.

### 🛠 **2. Debugging**
- AI execution can **pause** at critical points, allowing developers to check the intermediate state.
- Example: A **customer support chatbot** is paused if a response seems **inappropriate**.

### ✏ **3. Editing**
- Users can **modify AI decisions** before continuing.
- Example: A **content generation AI** pauses before publishing a blog post, allowing an editor to make final changes.

---

## 🏗 **Implementing Breakpoints in LangGraph**
### 🚀 **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
Before using LangGraph, install the required libraries:
```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_openai langgraph_sdk
```
---
### 🔑 **Step 2: Setting Up API Keys**
Since we’re using OpenAI’s models, we need to set up the API key:
```python
import os, getpass

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- This function checks if the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the environment.
- If not, it prompts the user to input the key.

---
### 📌 **Step 3: Defining Tools (Mathematical Operations)**
We define basic arithmetic functions that our AI agent can use:
```python
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Multiplies two numbers."""
    return a * b

def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds two numbers."""
    return a + b

def divide(a: int, b: int) -> float:
    """Divides two numbers."""
    return a / b
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
These functions will act as **tools** for the AI to use.

---
### 🔗 **Step 4: Creating an AI Model with Tools**
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

tools = [add, multiply, divide]
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- We initialize **ChatOpenAI** using GPT-4o.
- We bind our **math functions as tools** so the AI can use them.

---
### 🎭 **Step 5: Defining the AI Assistant**
```python
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage

sys_msg = SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant performing arithmetic operations.")

def assistant(state: MessagesState):
   return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke([sys_msg] + state["messages"])]}
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- The **assistant function** processes user messages.
- It **invokes** the AI model and returns a response.

---
### 🏗 **Step 6: Building the Execution Graph**
```python
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition, ToolNode

# Create a state-based execution graph
builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define nodes
builder.add_node("assistant", assistant)
builder.add_node("tools", ToolNode(tools))

# Define control flow
builder.add_edge(START, "assistant")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "assistant",
    tools_condition,
)
builder.add_edge("tools", "assistant")
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- We define an execution **graph** that manages AI decision-making.
- The AI first interacts with the **assistant node**.
- If the AI decides to use a tool, the execution moves to the **tools node**.
- Otherwise, it **ends execution**.

---
### ⏸ **Step 7: Adding a Breakpoint**
```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(interrupt_before=["tools"], checkpointer=memory)
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- `interrupt_before=["tools"]` **pauses execution** before the tool is used.
- This allows a **human to approve** or modify the operation before it continues.

---
### 📊 **Step 8: Running the Graph with Breakpoints**
```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

# Visualize the graph
display(Image(graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))

# User Input
initial_input = {"messages": HumanMessage(content="Multiply 2 and 3")}
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event['messages'][-1].pretty_print()
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- The execution graph **runs until it reaches a breakpoint**.
- The AI suggests using the **multiply tool**, but execution **pauses** for human approval.

---
### 🔎 **Step 9: Checking the AI’s Current State**
```python
state = graph.get_state(thread)
state.next
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- We **inspect the AI’s state** to see where it paused.
- The output will confirm that execution stopped at `"tools"`.

---
## 🎯 **Real-World Applications of Breakpoints**
### 🏦 **1. Fraud Prevention in Banking**
- A **fraud detection AI** pauses transactions that seem **suspicious** for human review.

### 🏥 **2. Medical Diagnosis**
- A **healthcare AI** pauses before making **critical recommendations**.

### 🤖 **3. AI-Assisted Content Creation**

# 🚀 **Building an AI Assistant for Arithmetic Operations Using LangGraph & LangChain**

## 📌 **Introduction**
In this guide, we will build an **AI-powered arithmetic assistant** that can process user input and intelligently decide when to use predefined mathematical tools (like multiplication). We will utilize **LangGraph** (a framework for structured AI workflows) and **LangChain** (a library for building AI applications).

By the end of this tutorial, you will:
✅ Understand how to create a structured AI decision-making system.  
✅ Learn how to define an execution graph that handles AI interactions.  
✅ Implement a **breakpoint system** to pause execution for manual review.  
✅ Use **state management** to control AI behavior dynamically.  

Let's break everything down step by step! 🔎

---

## 🏗 **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**
Before we begin, we need to import the necessary libraries.

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, START, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition, ToolNode
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- `IPython.display.Image, display` → Used to **visualize** the AI execution graph.
- `MemorySaver` → Stores checkpoints to pause and resume execution.
- `MessagesState` → Represents the **state** of messages exchanged between the user and AI.
- `StateGraph` → The core **workflow engine** that manages decision-making.
- `START` → Represents the **beginning** of the execution graph.
- `ToolNode` → Defines nodes responsible for **executing specific functions**.
- `AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage` → Represent messages exchanged between **AI and user**.

---

## 🛠 **Step 2: Define System Message**
We need to instruct the AI about its role.

```python
sys_msg = SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant tasked with performing arithmetic on a set of inputs.")
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- This **system message** sets the **AI’s behavior** (acting as a math assistant).
- This message will always be included when processing user inputs.

---

## 🤖 **Step 3: Create the AI Assistant Function**
The **assistant function** processes user queries.

```python
def assistant(state: MessagesState):
   return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke([sys_msg] + state["messages"])]}
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- The function takes **MessagesState** as input, which contains **previous interactions**.
- It **invokes** the AI model (`llm_with_tools`) with:
  1. `sys_msg` → Tells AI that it's a math assistant.
  2. `state["messages"]` → The **latest messages** from the user.
- The function **returns** the AI's response.

---

## 🔗 **Step 4: Build the AI Execution Graph**
We now define how our AI processes user input.

```python
builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define nodes: these perform tasks
builder.add_node("assistant", assistant)
builder.add_node("tools", ToolNode(tools))

# Define control flow
builder.add_edge(START, "assistant")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "assistant",
    tools_condition,
)
builder.add_edge("tools", "assistant")
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- **StateGraph(MessagesState)** → Creates a **workflow graph**.
- **add_node("assistant", assistant)** → Adds the **assistant** as a node.
- **add_node("tools", ToolNode(tools))** → Adds a **tools node** for performing calculations.
- **add_edge(START, "assistant")** → AI starts by processing user input.
- **add_conditional_edges("assistant", tools_condition)** → 
  - If AI **needs a tool**, it moves to the **tools node**.
  - Otherwise, it **ends execution**.
- **add_edge("tools", "assistant")** → After tool execution, control **returns to AI**.

---

## ⏸ **Step 5: Add a Breakpoint**
We introduce **interruptions** before executing tools.

```python
memory = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(interrupt_before=["tools"], checkpointer=memory)
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- **interrupt_before=["tools"]** → Stops execution **before a tool is used**.
- **MemorySaver()** → Stores **AI progress** so it can be resumed later.

---

## 📊 **Step 6: Visualizing the Execution Graph**
To understand how AI decisions flow, we generate a **graph visualization**.

```python
display(Image(graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- This **visualizes the AI decision-making process**.
- Helps debug and improve AI behavior.

---

## 📝 **Step 7: Providing User Input**
Now, we simulate a user asking the AI to multiply two numbers.

```python
initial_input = {"messages": HumanMessage(content="Multiply 2 and 3")}
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- Creates a **human message** where the user requests multiplication.

---

## 🧵 **Step 8: Defining a Thread**
Each **conversation session** is tracked using a thread.

```python
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- Assigns a **unique ID** to keep track of ongoing conversations.

---

## 🚀 **Step 9: Running the AI Execution Graph**
We **execute** the AI workflow until a breakpoint is reached.

```python
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event['messages'][-1].pretty_print()
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- The AI **processes the request** and **pauses at the tool execution step**.
- The output will look like this:

```
================================ Human Message =================================
Multiply 2 and 3
================================== AI Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  multiply (call_eqlctYi3bluPXUgdW0Ac6Abr)
 Call ID: call_eqlctYi3bluPXUgdW0Ac6Abr
  Args:
    a: 2
    b: 3
```

- AI **determines that it needs to use the `multiply` tool**.
- The **graph pauses** at `tools`, awaiting confirmation.

---

## 🔎 **Step 10: Checking AI's Current State**
We inspect where execution has paused.

```python
state = graph.get_state(thread)
state.next
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- This command **retrieves the current AI state**.
- The output confirms execution stopped at **"tools"**.

```
('tools',)
```

---

## ▶ **Step 11: Resuming Execution**
After review, we **resume execution**.

```python
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event['messages'][-1].pretty_print()
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**
- **Passing `None`** → Resumes execution from the last checkpoint.
- The tool executes the multiplication and **returns the final answer**.

```
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: multiply
6
================================== AI Message ==================================
The result of multiplying 2 and 3 is 6.
```

---

## 🌍 **Real-World Applications**
This system is not just for arithmetic! It can be extended for:
✅ **Customer Support Bots** → AI can decide when to fetch data from external APIs.  
✅ **AI-powered Data Processing** → Automate tasks like **calculations, searches, and form filling**.  
✅ **Interactive Learning Assistants** → AI can help students by **providing step-by-step solutions**.

---

## 🎯 **Conclusion**
You have successfully built an **AI-driven assistant** that:
✅ **Processes user queries** dynamically.  
✅ **Decides when to use tools** for calculations.  
✅ **Pauses execution for human review** when necessary.  
✅ **Resumes from the last state** for efficient execution.  

This architecture can be expanded to **handle complex AI workflows**, making it a powerful tool for AI-driven automation! 🚀💡

# 🔥 Deep Dive into LangGraph with User Approval in Python

## 📌 Introduction
In this guide, we will explore **LangGraph**, a powerful framework that allows us to create **graph-based workflows** for handling tool calls in AI-powered applications. We will take a beginner-friendly approach, breaking down each concept, its purpose, and a **real-world use case**. 

At the end, you will understand:
- **How to structure an AI workflow using LangGraph**
- **How to integrate tool calls (like a calculator) into the workflow**
- **How to introduce user approval before executing a tool**
- **How this applies to real-world applications like AI assistants**

---

## 🚀 What is LangGraph?
**LangGraph** is a library used to create **workflow graphs** where each step in the process is represented as a **node**. These nodes interact with each other to process user input, call tools (functions), and generate responses.

Imagine an AI chatbot that helps you **solve math problems** step by step. Instead of just returning an answer, we **design a flow** where the AI:
1. Receives user input.
2. Decides if a tool (like a calculator) is needed.
3. Asks for user approval before proceeding.
4. Executes the tool and returns the result.

This structured approach ensures transparency and user control over AI actions.

---

## 🎯 Real-World Use Case: AI Assistant for Financial Calculations
🔹 Imagine you’re building a **financial AI assistant** that helps users calculate **loan interest, investment growth, or tax deductions**. Before the assistant performs a sensitive calculation, it **asks for user approval**. This prevents unnecessary calculations and gives users control over the AI's actions.

---

## 📝 Understanding the Code (Step-by-Step Explanation)

Let's break down the LangGraph implementation with **user approval** before executing a tool.

### **🔹 Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries**
```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, START, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition, ToolNode

from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage
```
📌 **What’s happening?**
- We import `IPython.display` to visualize the graph.
- `MemorySaver` allows us to **store and resume** the graph state.
- `StateGraph` is the core of our workflow.
- `Tools_condition` helps decide when a tool should be used.
- `AIMessage`, `HumanMessage`, and `SystemMessage` define different **types of messages**.

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Define the System Message**
```python
sys_msg = SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant tasked with performing arithmetic on a set of inputs.")
```
📌 **Why do we need this?**
- This sets the **AI's role** in the system.
- The AI assistant is designed specifically for **arithmetic operations**.

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Define the Assistant Node**
```python
def assistant(state: MessagesState):
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke([sys_msg] + state["messages"])]}
```
📌 **Breaking it down:**
- This function is the **brain** of our graph.
- It takes the user’s input (`state["messages"]`).
- It **invokes the AI assistant** (`llm_with_tools.invoke(...)`).
- It **returns a response** with updated messages.

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Create the Graph Structure**
```python
builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
```
📌 **What’s happening?**
- We initialize a **graph workflow** using `StateGraph`.
- This structure allows us to define different **nodes**.

---

### **🔹 Step 5: Add Nodes to the Graph**
```python
builder.add_node("assistant", assistant)
builder.add_node("tools", ToolNode(tools))
```
📌 **Why are we doing this?**
- **"assistant" node:** Handles AI responses.
- **"tools" node:** Executes external tool calls (like multiplication).

---

### **🔹 Step 6: Define Edges for Flow Control**
```python
builder.add_edge(START, "assistant")
builder.add_conditional_edges("assistant", tools_condition)
builder.add_edge("tools", "assistant")
```
📌 **What’s happening?**
- The **flow starts** at the **assistant**.
- If the AI **detects a tool call**, the workflow moves to `"tools"`.
- Once the tool executes, the workflow returns to `"assistant"`.

---

### **🔹 Step 7: Add Memory Checkpointing**
```python
memory = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(interrupt_before=["tools"], checkpointer=memory)
```
📌 **Why is this important?**
- `MemorySaver()` **saves graph progress** so we can resume execution later.
- `interrupt_before=["tools"]` **pauses execution** before calling a tool.

---

### **🔹 Step 8: Visualize the Graph**
```python
display(Image(graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))
```
📌 **What does this do?**
- Generates a **visual representation** of our AI assistant’s workflow.

---

### **🔹 Step 9: User Input & Graph Execution**
```python
initial_input = {"messages": HumanMessage(content="Multiply 2 and 3")}
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}

for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event['messages'][-1].pretty_print()
```
📌 **Explanation:**
1. We **define user input** (`Multiply 2 and 3`).
2. A **unique thread ID** is assigned.
3. The **graph executes** until it reaches the tool call.

---

### **🔹 Step 10: Introduce User Approval**
```python
user_approval = input("Do you want to call the tool? (yes/no): ")

if user_approval.lower() == "yes":
    for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
        event['messages'][-1].pretty_print()
else:
    print("Operation cancelled by user.")
```
📌 **What’s happening?**
1. The system **pauses execution** and asks for **user approval**.
2. If the user types `"yes"`, the **graph resumes execution**.
3. If the user types `"no"`, the **operation is cancelled**.

---

## 📌 Expected Output

```
================================ Human Message =================================
Multiply 2 and 3

================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  multiply (call_2spIVnq7DwMdttrbKr7oY9Gs)
  Args:
    a: 2
    b: 3

Do you want to call the tool? (yes/no): yes

================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: multiply
6

================================== Ai Message ==================================
The result of multiplying 2 and 3 is 6.
```

# 🚀 Breakpoints with LangGraph API: A Beginner-Friendly Guide

## 📌 Introduction  
LangGraph API allows developers to build structured workflows with AI models. One of its powerful features is **breakpoints**, which help pause execution at specific steps for manual intervention, debugging, or conditional execution.

In this guide, we'll break down the **breakpoints** concept in LangGraph, **how to use them**, and provide **real-world use cases** with **detailed code explanations**.

---

## 🔎 What Are Breakpoints?  

A **breakpoint** in programming is a **pause in execution** that allows us to inspect variables, manually intervene, or make decisions before continuing. In LangGraph, we can interrupt execution **before** a specific step, like calling a tool or processing an input.

### 🛠 Real-World Use Cases of Breakpoints in AI  
- **Human-in-the-loop AI**: Before an AI sends an automated email, a user can review and approve it.  
- **Debugging AI Workflows**: Inspect messages exchanged in a chatbot to fix logic errors.  
- **Conditional Execution**: Before running a function, check if the input is correct.  

---

## 🔥 Implementing Breakpoints in LangGraph API  

### 📝 Step 1: Setting Up the Environment  
Before using LangGraph, ensure you have the required dependencies. If you're using **Google Colab** or a **non-Mac OS**, LangGraph Studio might not work.

```python
import platform

# Check if the environment supports LangGraph Studio
if 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython()) or platform.system() != 'Darwin':
    raise Exception("Unfortunately LangGraph Studio is currently not supported on Google Colab or requires a Mac")
```
🔍 **Explanation:**  
- The `platform.system()` function checks if the system is Mac (`Darwin`).  
- The `get_ipython()` function checks if the script is running in Google Colab.  
- If **not supported**, an exception is raised.

---

### 📝 Step 2: Connecting to LangGraph API  

Now, let's initialize a **client** connection to the LangGraph API.

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

# Connect to the LangGraph API running locally
client = get_client(url="http://localhost:56091")
```
🔍 **Explanation:**  
- `get_client(url)` initializes a connection to the **LangGraph server**.  
- The `url="http://localhost:56091"` is where the LangGraph service is running.

---

### 📝 Step 3: Running a Graph with a Breakpoint  

We create an **initial input message** and a **new thread** in LangGraph.

```python
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage

# Define initial user input
initial_input = {"messages": HumanMessage(content="Multiply 2 and 3")}

# Create a new execution thread
thread = await client.threads.create()

# Stream the execution with a breakpoint before calling a tool
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id="agent",
    input=initial_input,
    stream_mode="values",
    interrupt_before=["tools"],  # Set a breakpoint before using tools
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    messages = chunk.data.get('messages', [])
    if messages:
        print(messages[-1])  # Print the latest message
    print("-" * 50)
```
🔍 **Explanation:**  
- `HumanMessage(content="Multiply 2 and 3")` is a user request.  
- `client.threads.create()` initializes a **new conversation thread**.  
- `client.runs.stream(...)` runs the execution **asynchronously**, meaning it doesn't block other tasks.  
- `interrupt_before=["tools"]` pauses execution **before calling a tool**, allowing us to inspect messages.  
- The loop processes **incoming messages** and prints them.

---

### 📌 Step 4: Handling the Breakpoint & Resuming Execution  

Once execution is paused at the breakpoint, we **manually approve** whether to proceed.

```python
# Get user feedback to continue or stop execution
user_approval = input("Do you want to call the tool? (yes/no): ")

# Check approval
if user_approval.lower() == "yes":
    # Continue execution
    async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
        thread["thread_id"],
        assistant_id="agent",
        input=None,  # Resume without new input
        stream_mode="values",
        interrupt_before=["tools"],
    ):
        print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
        messages = chunk.data.get('messages', [])
        if messages:
            print(messages[-1])
        print("-" * 50)
else:
    print("Operation cancelled by user.")
```
🔍 **Explanation:**  
- The `input()` function asks the user if they want to proceed.  
- If the user types `"yes"`, the execution **continues**; otherwise, it's **canceled**.  
- `input=None` means we continue **from where we left off** without new user input.

---

### 📌 Step 5: Processing the AI’s Final Output  

Once execution resumes, LangGraph continues processing:

```plaintext
Receiving new event of type: metadata...
--------------------------------------------------
Receiving new event of type: values...
{'content': 'Multiply 2 and 3', 'type': 'human'}
--------------------------------------------------
Receiving new event of type: values...
{'content': '', 'tool_calls': [{'name': 'multiply', 'args': {'a': 2, 'b': 3}}]}
--------------------------------------------------
Receiving new event of type: values...
{'content': '6', 'type': 'tool'}
--------------------------------------------------
Receiving new event of type: values...
{'content': 'The result of multiplying 2 and 3 is 6.', 'type': 'ai'}
--------------------------------------------------
```
🔍 **Explanation:**  
- The AI **understands** the user request `"Multiply 2 and 3"`.  
- It **calls the multiplication tool** with `a=2, b=3`.  
- The tool **returns `6`** as the result.  
- The AI **responds to the user**: `"The result of multiplying 2 and 3 is 6."`

---

## 📌 Summary  

✅ **Breakpoints** in LangGraph allow us to **pause execution** before specific steps.  
✅ They are useful for **human intervention**, **debugging**, and **conditional execution**.  
✅ We can **manually approve** or **inspect data** before continuing.  
✅ The process includes **initializing a client, streaming execution, handling breakpoints, and resuming execution**.

---

## 🎯 Real-World Applications of LangGraph Breakpoints  

📌 **Automated AI Email Drafting**: Pause execution before an AI sends an email to **let a human review it**.  
📌 **Medical AI Chatbots**: Before providing a medical recommendation, **a doctor can verify it**.  
📌 **Customer Support AI**: AI pauses before resolving a complex customer query, allowing a **human agent to intervene**.  

---

# 🛠️ **Understanding Breakpoints in LangGraph API with Code Explanation**  

## 🔹 **What are Breakpoints in LangGraph API?**  
Breakpoints in LangGraph API allow us to pause execution at specific points, such as before using external tools, so that we can inspect or modify the execution flow before continuing.  

## 📌 **Real-World Use Case**  
Consider a **customer support chatbot** that integrates with external databases or APIs to fetch order details. Using breakpoints, we can:  
- Pause before fetching sensitive data.  
- Get user approval before calling an API (to prevent unnecessary API costs).  
- Debug and monitor responses step by step.

## 📜 **Code Breakdown & Explanation**  

### **1️⃣ Import Required Module**  
```python
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage
```  
✅ **What This Does:**  
- Imports `HumanMessage` from `langchain.schema`, which represents a message from a human user in a conversational AI system.  

---

### **2️⃣ Define Initial User Input**  
```python
initial_input = {"messages": HumanMessage(content="Multiply 2 and 3")}
```  
✅ **What This Does:**  
- Creates an input dictionary where `messages` contain a `HumanMessage` with the content `"Multiply 2 and 3"`.  
- This input will be used to start a conversation with the AI assistant.  

---

### **3️⃣ Create a New Execution Thread**  
```python
thread = await client.threads.create()
```  
✅ **What This Does:**  
- Calls `client.threads.create()` asynchronously to create a new **execution thread**.  
- Each thread maintains the **context of a conversation** (like a chat session).  
- `await` ensures that the function completes before moving forward.  

---

### **4️⃣ Stream Execution with Breakpoints**  
```python
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id="agent",
    input=initial_input,
    stream_mode="values",
    interrupt_before=["tools"],  # Set a breakpoint before using tools
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    messages = chunk.data.get('messages', [])
    if messages:
        print(messages[-1])  # Print the latest message
    print("-" * 50)
```  
✅ **What This Does:**  
1. **Streams execution asynchronously**:  
   - Calls `client.runs.stream()` to start streaming responses from the assistant.  
2. **Parameters Explained:**  
   - `thread["thread_id"]` → Specifies which thread (conversation session) to use.  
   - `assistant_id="agent"` → Identifies the assistant model handling the request.  
   - `input=initial_input` → Provides the user input (`Multiply 2 and 3`).  
   - `stream_mode="values"` → Indicates that we are streaming values (responses).  
   - `interrupt_before=["tools"]` → **Sets a breakpoint before executing any external tools** (e.g., calling a function to multiply numbers).  
3. **Loop Behavior:**  
   - The code iterates over each response `chunk`.  
   - `chunk.event` → Displays the type of event received (e.g., metadata, AI-generated response).  
   - `messages = chunk.data.get('messages', [])` → Extracts the latest messages.  
   - `if messages:` → If messages exist, print the last one.  
   - `print("-" * 50)` → Prints a separator for readability.  

---

### **5️⃣ Get User Approval to Continue Execution**  
```python
user_approval = input("Do you want to call the tool? (yes/no): ")
```  
✅ **What This Does:**  
- **Pauses execution** and asks the user if they want to continue.  
- If the user enters `"yes"`, the program will proceed to execute the multiplication.  
- If `"no"`, execution will be stopped.  

---

### **6️⃣ Check Approval & Continue or Stop Execution**  
#### ✅ **If User Approves, Resume Execution**
```python
if user_approval.lower() == "yes":
    async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
        thread["thread_id"],
        assistant_id="agent",
        input=None,  # Resume without new input
        stream_mode="values",
        interrupt_before=["tools"],
    ):
        print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
        messages = chunk.data.get('messages', [])
        if messages:
            print(messages[-1])
        print("-" * 50)
```  
✔️ **What This Does:**  
- If the user types `"yes"`, execution resumes **without new input** (`input=None`).  
- The process continues with the same thread and assistant.  
- It re-streams responses, printing each message as before.  

---

#### ❌ **If User Declines, Stop Execution**
```python
else:
    print("Operation cancelled by user.")
```  
✔️ **What This Does:**  
- If the user enters `"no"`, the program simply prints a message and **does not continue execution**.

## 🎯 **Summary of Key Concepts**  
🔹 **Breakpoints in LangGraph API** allow us to pause execution before calling external tools.  
🔹 **Real-world applications** include chatbot debugging, preventing unnecessary API calls, and user-approved interactions.  
🔹 **Streaming execution** ensures that responses are processed dynamically, rather than waiting for a complete response.  
🔹 **User-controlled flow** enables interactive debugging or decision-making before executing further logic.
