# Define GraphÂ¶
Now, create the graph. The graph is the final assistant for this section.

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition

builder = StateGraph(State)


# Define nodes: these do the work
builder.add_node("assistant", Assistant(part_1_assistant_runnable))
builder.add_node("tools", create_tool_node_with_fallback(part_1_tools))
# Define edges: these determine how the control flow moves
builder.add_edge(START, "assistant")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "assistant",
    tools_condition,
)
builder.add_edge("tools", "assistant")

# The checkpointer lets the graph persist its state
# this is a complete memory for the entire graph.
memory = MemorySaver()
part_1_graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)

# Example ConversationÂ¶
Now it's time to try out our mighty chatbot! Let's run it over the following list of dialog turns. If it hits a "RecursionLimit", that means the agent wasn't able to get an answer in the allocated number of steps. That's OK! We have more tricks up our sleeve in later sections of this tutorial.

```python

# Let's create an example conversation a user might have with the assistant
tutorial_questions = [
    "Hi there, what time is my flight?",
    "Am i allowed to update my flight to something sooner? I want to leave later today.",
    "Update my flight to sometime next week then",

    "what about lodging and transportation?",
    "Yeah i think i'd like an affordable hotel for my week-long stay (7 days). And I'll want to rent a car.",
    "OK could you place a reservation for your recommended hotel? It sounds nice.",
    "yes go ahead and book anything that's moderate expense and has availability.",
    "Now for a car, what are my options?",
    "Awesome let's just get the cheapest option. Go ahead and book for 7 days",
    "Cool so now what recommendations do you have on excursions?",
    "Are they available while I'm there?",
    "interesting - i like the museums, what options are there? ",
    "OK great pick one and book it for my second day there.",

## Booking and Cancellation

1. How can I change my booking?
    * The ticket number must start with 724 (SWISS ticket no./plate).
    * The ticket was not paid for by barter or voucher (there are exceptions to voucher payments; if the ticket was paid for in full by voucher, then it may be possible to rebook online under certain circumstances. If it is not possible to rebook online because of the payment method, then you will be informed accordingly during the rebooking process).
    * There must be an active flight booking for your ticket. It is not possible to rebook open tickets or tickets without the corresponding flight segments online at the moment.
    * It is currently only possible to rebook outbound (one-way) tickets or return tickets with single flight routes (point-to-point).
2. Which tickets/bookings cannot be rebooked online currently?
    * Bookings containing flight segments with other airlines
    * Bookings containing reservations, where a ticket has not yet been issued
    * Bookings with several valid tickets for the same person and route
    * Tickets with a status other than O (open) (A)
    * Bookings with segments with a status other than OK (e.g. containing flight segments with the status Waitlist) (HK|RR)
    * Tickets that do not display the tariff calculation (IT tickets)
    * Bookings that contain special services (e.g. transportation of animals/transportation of medica ... (truncated)
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Based on the policy information, it looks like you are generally allowed to change your flight on the same day for an earlier option, provided your ticket number starts with 724 and some other conditions are met. However, to check if your specific ticket can be updated today, I will need to look up your ticket number or booking reference.

Could you please provide your ticket number or booking reference? Then I can check your flight details and whether you are eligible to change to an earlier flight today per the policy.

The policy states that you are generally allowed to change your flight and travel dates online, as long as your ticket number starts with 724 and meets the other conditions listed.

To proceed with changing your flight to sometime next week, I'll need your ticket number or booking reference. Once I have that, I can look up your specific reservation details and change your flight dates if permitted based on your fare type and the availability of flights.

Please provide me with your ticket number or booking reference whenever you're ready.

I'm really struggling to find any recommended activities, tours or excursions to book for your stay in the Basel area. It seems the database may be lacking robust options for that region. 

Instead, here are a few potential ideas I could recommend based on some quick research:

- Take a day trip to Lucerne and go see the iconic Chapel Bridge and Lion Monument
- Visit the Swiss Vapeur Parc, an amusement park focused on trains and transportation
- Go for a hike up Gempenplateau for scenic views overlooking Basel
- Take a food tour to sample the local Swiss cuisine like rÃ¶sti and fondue
- Do a wine tasting day trip out to the vineyards near Alsace, France

Let me know if any of those appeal to you or if you'd like me to find some other moderate activity recommendations for your Basel stay. I can also hold off on booking excursions for now if you prefer to play that portion by ear once there. Just let me know your preference!

I'm really struggling to find bookable tours or excursions through this system for the Basel/Switzerland area. However, based on some additional research, here are some top recommendations I can provide:

- Take a day trip to Lucerne and go see the iconic Chapel Bridge, Lion Monument, and do a lake cruise
- Visit the Rhine Falls near Schaffhausen - one of the largest waterfalls in Europe
- Take a guided walking tour through Basel's old town to see the red sandstone buildings and historical sites
- Do a day trip into the Swiss Alps, potentially taking a cogwheel train up into the mountains
- Tour the medieval ChÃ¢teau de Bottmingen just outside of Basel
- Take a day trip across the border to explore the Alsace wine region of France
- Visit the Fondation Beyeler museum that houses an impressive modern art collection

Unfortunately it does not look like my searches are returning any bookable tours or excursions in the Basel area for those date ranges. The database seems to be lacking comprehensive options.

As an alternative, let me suggest just keeping your schedule flexible during your stay. With your rental car, you can easily do self-guided day trips to places like:

- Lucerne (1.5 hour drive)
- Bern (1 hour drive) 
- Zurich (1 hour drive)
- Rhine Falls (45 min drive)
- Alsace, France (1 hour drive)

And in Basel itself, you can explore at your own pace hitting top sights like:

- Basel Munster cathedral 
- Old Town
- Basel Paper Mill Museum
- Rhine river promenades

There are also several highly-rated free walking tour companies that operate daily in Basel you could join.

Rather than pre-booking rigid excursions, having the rental car will give you maximum flexibility to pick and choose what you want to do day-to-day based on your interests and the weather.

Let me know if you'd still like me to continue searching for pre-bookable tours, or if you're okay winging it and using the rental car to explore Basel and do day trips during your week there.

Unfortunately I'm still not getting any hits on pre-bookable museum tours or exhibits for the Switzerland/Basel area during your dates. However, from my research, here are some of the top museums I would recommend checking out:

In Basel:
- Kunstmuseum Basel - This is one of the largest and best art museums in Switzerland with excellent collections of paintings, sculptures, and drawings.
- Fondation Beyeler - Fantastic modern/contemporary art museum with works by Monet, Warhol, Bacon and more. A bit outside the city center.
- Basel Paper Mill Museum - Unique museum tracing the history of paper and paper-making.
- Spielzeug Welten Museum - Fun toy and doll museum for kids and adults alike.

Day Trips: 
- Albertina Museum (Zurich) - Impressive collections of modern art and photography
- Sammlung Rosengart (Lucerne) - Housing works by Picasso, CÃ©zanne, Klee and more
- Olympic Museum (Lausanne) 

Since I couldn't find any pre-booked options, I'd recommend just planning to visit whichever museums pique your interest most once you're in Basel, using your rental car to get around. Most are open daily with ticket purchases available on-site. Let me know if you need any other museum recommendations!
================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

OK great pick one and book it for my second day there.
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Sure, let's book an museum visit for your second day in Basel, which will be Wednesday, May 9th.

Based on the excellent museum options you have in Basel itself, I'd recommend visiting the acclaimed Kunstmuseum Basel, one of the largest and most impressive art museums in Switzerland.

While I couldn't find a way to pre-book tickets or tours through this system, the Kunstmuseum is open daily, and we can plan for you to purchase tickets directly there on May 9th.

Here are some highlights of the Kunstmuseum Basel that make it a great option:

- It houses the largest and most significant public art collection in the entire country
- The collection spans from the 15th century up through contemporary art
- Notable works by Holbein, Witz, Cranach, BÃ¶cklin, CÃ©zanne, Gauguin, Monet, Picasso and more
- The main building was designed by Christ & Gantenbein and has received architectural awards
- They have excellent audio guide tours available in multiple languages
- The museum is conveniently located in the city center, about a 10 minute walk from your hotel

My recommendation would be to plan to arrive at the Kunstmuseum Basel around 10am on Wednesday, May 9th after breakfast. This will allow you to purchase tickets and take your time exploring their impeccable collections and audio tours.

Let me know if you'd like to book the Kunstmuseum for the morning of May 9th, or if you had another museum  ... (truncated)

# ð **Building a Zero-Shot Agent with LangGraph**  

This guide will walk you through building a **Zero-Shot Agent** using **LangGraph**. Iâll explain everything in a **beginner-friendly** way, breaking down the **code line by line** and explaining the **logic** behind it. We'll also cover how to create and run an **example conversation** with the chatbot.  

---

## ð§© **Part 1: Understanding the Graph Structure**  

### ð¡ **What is a Graph in this Context?**  
A **graph** here represents the **workflow** of our chatbotâhow it moves between different tasks (like answering questions, searching for flights, booking hotels, etc.).  
- **Nodes** represent tasks (e.g., answering a userâs question).  
- **Edges** represent the flow from one task to another.

---

## ð¨ **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**  

Before we build the graph, we need some essential modules:

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition
```

### ð **Explanation**  
- `MemorySaver`: ð Saves the state of the graph so it can resume from where it left off.  
- `END`, `START`: ð Special markers to indicate where the graph starts and ends.  
- `StateGraph`: ð Main structure for building the graph.  
- `tools_condition`: ð Checks if the chatbot needs extra tools to answer user questions.

---

## ðï¸ **Step 2: Create the Graph**  

```python
builder = StateGraph(State)
```

### ð **Explanation**  
- `StateGraph(State)`: Initializes the graph with a **state**. The **state** holds the conversation history, so the bot remembers past interactions.

---

## ð **Step 3: Add Nodes to the Graph**  

```python
builder.add_node("assistant", Assistant(part_1_assistant_runnable))
builder.add_node("tools", create_tool_node_with_fallback(part_1_tools))
```

### ð **Explanation**  
- **assistant** ð§âð¼: The chatbot that replies to users.  
- **tools** ð ï¸: A set of extra tools (like searching for flights, booking hotels) that the assistant can use if needed.

---

## ð **Step 4: Connect Nodes with Edges**  

```python
builder.add_edge(START, "assistant")
builder.add_conditional_edges("assistant", tools_condition)
builder.add_edge("tools", "assistant")
```

### ð **Explanation**  
- `add_edge(START, "assistant")`: The conversation **starts** with the assistant.  
- `add_conditional_edges`: Checks if tools are needed. If yes, the flow moves to the **tools** node.  
- `add_edge("tools", "assistant")`: After tools complete their job, control goes back to the assistant.

---

## ð¾ **Step 5: Add Memory (State Persistence)**  

```python
memory = MemorySaver()
part_1_graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

### ð **Explanation**  
- **MemorySaver()** ð¾: Stores the graph's state (chat history, bookings, etc.).  
- **compile()** ð ï¸: Finalizes the graph for execution, with memory included.

---

## ð¼ï¸ **Step 6: Visualize the Graph (Optional)**  

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(part_1_graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    pass
```

### ð **Explanation**  
- This will generate a **visual flowchart** ð¼ï¸ showing how the assistant moves between tasks.  
- If extra dependencies arenât installed, the `except` block will prevent the code from crashing.

---

## ð¬ **Step 7: Example Conversation**  

Now that our chatbot is ready, letâs test it with some **real conversations**.

### ð **Preparing the Test Conversation**

```python
import shutil
import uuid

tutorial_questions = [
    "Hi there, what time is my flight?",
    "Am I allowed to update my flight to something sooner?",
    "Update my flight to sometime next week then.",
    "The next available option is great.",
    "What about lodging and transportation?",
    "I would like an affordable hotel for my 7-day stay and a car rental.",
    "Please reserve your recommended hotel.",
    "Book any moderate-expense hotel with availability.",
    "What are my options for a rental car?",
    "Book the cheapest car for 7 days.",
    "What recommendations do you have on excursions?",
    "Are these excursions available during my stay?",
    "I like museums; what options are there?",
    "Great! Book one for my second day there.",
]

# Create a unique conversation ID
thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "passenger_id": "3442 587242",  # For fetching flight info
        "thread_id": thread_id,         # For saving conversation history
    }
}
```

---

### ð **Running the Chatbot Conversation**

```python
_printed = set()

for question in tutorial_questions:
    events = part_1_graph.stream(
        {"messages": ("user", question)}, config, stream_mode="values"
    )
    for event in events:
        _print_event(event, _printed)
```

### ð **Explanation (Line by Line)**  
- `tutorial_questions`: ð¬ A list of questions the user will ask.  
- `uuid.uuid4()`: ð Generates a unique ID for the conversation thread.  
- `part_1_graph.stream()`: ð Runs the conversation step by step.  
- `stream_mode="values"`: Ensures the chatbot replies **as it processes** each question.  
- `_print_event()`: ð¨ï¸ Displays the chatbotâs response after processing each user message.

---

## ð¯ **Key Concepts Recap**  
â **Graph Structure**: Defines how conversations flow.  
â **Nodes & Edges**: Represent tasks and their sequence.  
â **MemorySaver**: Keeps the conversation history intact.  
â **Stream Conversation**: Simulates a real chat between user and bot.  

---

## ð **Conclusion**  

ð Youâve just built a **Zero-Shot Agent** capable of:  
- Handling dynamic conversations  
- Searching for flights, hotels, and cars  
- Providing recommendations  
- Booking services seamlessly  

ð¡ **What's Next?**  
- Enhance the assistant with better fallback mechanisms.  
- Add more tools for broader capabilities.  
- Optimize the flow for complex conversations.

While the assistant does well in some areas, there are **critical issues** that need to be fixed:  

### â **1. Booking Mistakes**  
- **Problem:** The assistant **booked a car when the user was focusing on lodging.**  
- **Issue:** The bot later had to cancel and rebook, leading to **confusion and potential unwanted fees.**  
- **Solution:** The assistant should **always confirm** before making any bookings.  

### â **Fix: Adding User Confirmation Before Booking**  

We can fix this issue by **modifying our prompt** to require confirmation. Hereâs a **Python example using LangChain:**  

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Define a template with explicit confirmation
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["request"],
    template="User request: {request}\n\n"
             "Before booking, confirm with the user: 'Do you want to proceed with this booking? Yes/No'"
)

# Use OpenAI LLM
llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-4")

# Test the assistant's response
response = llm(prompt_template.format(request="Book a hotel in Paris"))
print(response)
```

### ð **Explanation:**  
1ï¸â£ **We define a `PromptTemplate`** that ensures the assistant **asks for user confirmation** before booking.  
2ï¸â£ **The assistant will prompt:** `"Do you want to proceed with this booking? Yes/No"` before executing any action.  
3ï¸â£ **The `OpenAI` model processes the prompt** and ensures bookings only happen with explicit user consent.

### â **2. Struggles with Searching for Recommendations**  
- **Problem:** The assistant **fails to find good travel recommendations** when asked.  
- **Issue:** Without clear **instructions and examples**, it does not use the tool effectively.  
- **Solution:** We need to **provide more structured examples** to guide the assistantâs behavior.

### â **Fix: Providing Clear Instructions & Examples**  

We can improve the assistantâs performance by **explicitly defining search steps** in our prompt.

```python
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["location"],
    template="User request: Find top travel recommendations for {location}\n\n"
             "Follow these steps:\n"
             "1. Search for highly-rated places on TripAdvisor and Google Reviews.\n"
             "2. Provide top 3 attractions with ratings.\n"
             "3. If no results are found, suggest popular alternative destinations."
)

response = llm(prompt_template.format(location="Paris"))
print(response)
```

### ð **Explanation:**  
1ï¸â£ **We structure the assistantâs search process into clear steps.**  
2ï¸â£ **The assistant now looks for top-rated places** using TripAdvisor and Google Reviews.  
3ï¸â£ **If no results are found, it suggests alternatives.**  
4ï¸â£ **This prevents vague or incomplete responses.**

### â **3. Redundant User Information Search**  
- **Problem:** The assistant **performs unnecessary searches** for user details.  
- **Issue:** Instead of asking for travel details repeatedly, it should **fetch and store user data for faster responses.**  
- **Solution:** We implement **a caching mechanism** to remember user details.

### â **Fix: Using Memory to Store User Travel Details**  

We use **LangChainâs Memory feature** to retain information across interactions.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

# Initialize memory to store user details
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()

# Store user travel preferences
memory.save_context({"user": "John"}, {"destination": "Paris", "budget": "$1500", "duration": "7 days"})

# Retrieve stored details
print(memory.load_memory_variables({}))
```

### ð **Explanation:**  
1ï¸â£ **We use `ConversationBufferMemory`** to store and retrieve user data.  
2ï¸â£ **The bot saves user preferences** (destination, budget, duration).  
3ï¸â£ **This reduces redundant searches**, making interactions smoother.

## ð¯ **Next Steps: Fixing These Issues in the Next Section**  
In the **next part**, we will:  
â Implement better booking logic with **confirmation checks**.  
â Improve search efficiency with **structured instructions**.  
â Optimize user experience by **storing travel details** efficiently.  

By applying these fixes, we can build **a smarter, more efficient assistant**! ð
