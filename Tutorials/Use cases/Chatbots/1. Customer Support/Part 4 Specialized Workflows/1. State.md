# Part 4: Specialized Workflows¶
In the previous sections, we saw how "wide" chat-bots, relying on a single prompt and LLM to handle various user intents, can get us far. However, it's difficult to create predictably great user experiences for known intents with this approach.

Alternatively, your graph can detect userintent and select the appropriate workflow or "skill" to satisfy the user's needs. Each workflow can focus on its domain, allowing for isolated improvements without degrading the overall assistant.

In this section, we'll split user experiences into separate sub-graphs, resulting in a structure like this:



In the diagram above, each square wraps an agentic, focused workflow. The primary assistant fields the user's initial queries, and the graph routes to the appropriate "expert" based on the query content.

# State¶
We want to keep track of which sub-graph is in control at any given moment. While we could do this through some arithmetic on the message list, it's easier to track as a dedicated stack.

Add a dialog_state list to the State below. Any time a node is run and returns a value for dialog_state, the update_dialog_stack function will be called to determine how to apply the update.

```python
from typing import Annotated, Literal, Optional

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph.message import AnyMessage, add_messages


def update_dialog_stack(left: list[str], right: Optional[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Push or pop the state."""
    if right is None:
        return left
    if right == "pop":
        return left[:-1]
    return left + [right]


class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    user_info: str
    dialog_state: Annotated[
        list[
            Literal[
                "assistant",
                "update_flight",
                "book_car_rental",
                "book_hotel",
                "book_excursion",
            ]
        ],
        update_dialog_stack,
    ]
API Reference: add_messages
```


# 🌟 **Part 4: Specialized Workflows**  

In this section, we’ll explore **specialized workflows** for chatbots. Instead of relying on one large language model (LLM) to handle everything, we’ll break tasks into smaller, specialized sub-graphs. Each sub-graph will focus on a specific user intent (like booking a hotel, updating a flight, etc.), making the chatbot more efficient, predictable, and user-friendly.  

---

## 📚 **Why Specialized Workflows?**  
When building complex chatbots, handling everything in a single flow is tough. For example, a travel assistant chatbot that helps with flights, hotels, cars, and excursions might struggle to manage everything at once.  

### ⚡ **Key Challenges Without Specialized Workflows:**  
1. **Complexity:** More tools and logic lead to messy code.  
2. **Reduced Accuracy:** One large LLM handling everything can make mistakes.  
3. **Difficult Improvements:** Changing one part of the workflow can affect the whole system.  

### ✅ **Benefits of Specialized Workflows:**  
1. **Modularity:** Each workflow can improve independently.  
2. **Efficiency:** Only relevant tools are used for each task.  
3. **Better Control:** Clear control over user experience for each intent.  

---

## 🌍 **Real-World Example: Travel Booking Assistant**  
Imagine a travel assistant that:  
- Updates flights  
- Books hotels  
- Reserves rental cars  
- Schedules excursions  

Each task is handled by a different specialized workflow. For example, if a user says:  
> _"I want to book a hotel for next week."_  
The chatbot identifies the intent (**book_hotel**) and routes the conversation to the hotel booking workflow, without affecting flight or car rental workflows.  

---

## 💾 **Understanding State Management**  
The **state** tracks the current status of the conversation, including:  
- Messages exchanged  
- User information  
- **Dialog state:** Which sub-graph is currently active  

We'll use a **stack** (like a pile of plates) for the `dialog_state`. This helps track which workflow is running and when to switch or return to previous ones.  

---

## 📝 **Code Breakdown with Explanations**  

### 🔧 **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**  
```python
from typing import Annotated, Literal, Optional
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph.message import AnyMessage, add_messages
```
- `typing`: Helps define data types for safety and clarity.  
- `TypedDict`: Defines a dictionary with specified keys and types.  
- `AnyMessage`: Represents any message in the conversation.  
- `add_messages`: Adds new messages to the conversation state.  

---

### 🔄 **Step 2: Create a Function to Manage Dialog State**  
```python
def update_dialog_stack(left: list[str], right: Optional[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Push or pop the state based on user interaction."""
    if right is None:
        return left
    if right == "pop":
        return left[:-1]  # Remove the last workflow (like popping a plate from a stack)
    return left + [right]  # Add a new workflow to the stack
```
- The **stack** tracks active workflows.  
- **Push**: Adds a new workflow when detected (e.g., `book_hotel`).  
- **Pop**: Removes a workflow when it completes.  

**🔍 Example:**  
If the user first updates a flight, then books a hotel:  
```python
["update_flight", "book_hotel"]
```
When the hotel booking finishes, we **pop**:  
```python
["update_flight"]
```

---

### 🏗️ **Step 3: Define the State Class**  
```python
class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]  # Stores conversation messages
    user_info: str  # Stores user details (e.g., passenger ID)
    dialog_state: Annotated[
        list[
            Literal[
                "assistant",
                "update_flight",
                "book_car_rental",
                "book_hotel",
                "book_excursion",
            ]
        ],
        update_dialog_stack,  # Uses the function above for stack management
    ]
```
- **messages**: History of all user and bot messages.  
- **user_info**: User-specific data (e.g., flight information).  
- **dialog_state**: Stack representing the current sub-graph in control.  

---

## 🌟 **How the Workflow Functions**  
### 🎯 **Detecting User Intent**  
The primary assistant will first process user input and then **route** to the appropriate sub-graph. For example:  
- **Intent:** “I want to update my flight.”  
  - Route to: `update_flight` workflow.  
- **Intent:** “Can you book a hotel for me?”  
  - Route to: `book_hotel` workflow.  

---

### 💬 **Example Workflow Routing**  
```python
def detect_intent(user_message: str) -> str:
    if "flight" in user_message.lower():
        return "update_flight"
    elif "hotel" in user_message.lower():
        return "book_hotel"
    elif "car" in user_message.lower():
        return "book_car_rental"
    elif "excursion" in user_message.lower():
        return "book_excursion"
    return "assistant"
```
- The **detect_intent** function scans user messages for keywords.  
- Based on the keyword, it routes the conversation to the appropriate workflow.  

---

### 🏃 **Example Run:**  
```python
# Simulating a user conversation
conversation = ["Hi! Can you book a hotel for me?"]

state = State(messages=[], user_info="Passenger_001", dialog_state=[])

for msg in conversation:
    intent = detect_intent(msg)
    state["dialog_state"] = update_dialog_stack(state["dialog_state"], intent)
    print(f"Current Workflow Stack: {state['dialog_state']}")
```

**Output:**  
```
Current Workflow Stack: ['book_hotel']
```

---

## 🎡 **Full Example: Handling Multiple User Requests**  
```python
conversation = [
    "Hi there! I want to update my flight.",
    "Now, I also need a hotel for next week.",
    "And I'd like to rent a car for 5 days.",
]

state = State(messages=[], user_info="Passenger_001", dialog_state=[])

for msg in conversation:
    intent = detect_intent(msg)
    state["dialog_state"] = update_dialog_stack(state["dialog_state"], intent)
    print(f"User said: '{msg}' ➡️ Current Workflow Stack: {state['dialog_state']}")

# Simulate completing the last workflow
state["dialog_state"] = update_dialog_stack(state["dialog_state"], "pop")
print(f"After completing a workflow: {state['dialog_state']}")
```

**Output:**  
```
User said: 'Hi there! I want to update my flight.' ➡️ Current Workflow Stack: ['update_flight']
User said: 'Now, I also need a hotel for next week.' ➡️ Current Workflow Stack: ['update_flight', 'book_hotel']
User said: 'And I'd like to rent a car for 5 days.' ➡️ Current Workflow Stack: ['update_flight', 'book_hotel', 'book_car_rental']
After completing a workflow: ['update_flight', 'book_hotel']
```

# 🚀 Part 4: Specialized Workflows in Chatbots

In previous sections, we saw how a chatbot could use a single **Large Language Model (LLM)** to process a wide range of user intents. While this approach works, it has limitations:

- It becomes hard to **predictably manage** user requests.
- As more **tools and logic** are added, maintaining **quality responses** for all intents gets complex.
- The chatbot might **struggle to prioritize** which actions to take.

To address these issues, we can **detect user intent** and route the conversation to specialized workflows or "skills." These workflows act as **expert modules**, handling specific types of user queries.

---

## 🎯 Why Use Specialized Workflows?

Instead of one assistant handling everything, we divide tasks into **focused sub-graphs**, where:

✅ **Each sub-graph handles a specific user intent**  
✅ **Tasks remain isolated**, preventing unintended interference  
✅ **New workflows can be added easily** without breaking existing ones  
✅ **Better performance** for complex workflows  

### 🏛️ Real-World Example: Travel Booking Assistant

Imagine you are building a **travel booking assistant**. Users might request:

- **Check flight details** 🛫  
- **Modify bookings** ✈️  
- **Reserve a hotel** 🏨  
- **Rent a car** 🚗  
- **Book excursions** 🎟️  

Each of these **tasks requires different logic**. Instead of one assistant trying to handle all, we can route each request to a specialized **workflow** (sub-graph).

---

## 🛠️ Implementing Specialized Workflows with Code

To create these **focused workflows**, we need a way to **track user interactions** and **route requests dynamically**.

### 🔹 Step 1: Define a `State` to Track Conversations

We need a **state object** that keeps track of:
1. **User messages** 💬
2. **User flight details** ✈️
3. **Current active workflow** (e.g., `update_flight`, `book_hotel`) 🔄

Let's define the `State` using Python's **TypedDict**:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Literal, Optional
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph.message import AnyMessage, add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    user_info: str
    dialog_state: Annotated[
        list[
            Literal[
                "assistant",          # Default assistant handling queries
                "update_flight",      # Specialized workflow for updating flights
                "book_car_rental",    # Specialized workflow for car rentals
                "book_hotel",         # Specialized workflow for hotel booking
                "book_excursion",     # Specialized workflow for excursions
            ]
        ],
        update_dialog_stack,
    ]
```

### 🔍 Explanation:
- `messages`: Stores all chat history.
- `user_info`: Stores user-specific details (e.g., flight information).
- `dialog_state`: Keeps track of which workflow is currently active.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Manage Dialog State with `update_dialog_stack()`

We need a function to **push and pop workflow states** dynamically.

```python
def update_dialog_stack(left: list[str], right: Optional[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Push or pop the state."""
    if right is None:
        return left  # No changes
    if right == "pop":
        return left[:-1]  # Remove the last state (go back)
    return left + [right]  # Add a new state
```

### 🔍 Explanation:
- If `right` is `None`, we **keep the existing state**.
- If `right` is `"pop"`, we **remove the last active workflow** (go back).
- Otherwise, we **add a new workflow to the stack**.

🔹 **Why is this useful?**  
Imagine a user starts booking a hotel but then decides to modify their flight instead. The chatbot should **switch workflows dynamically** without losing track.

---

## 📌 How Does This Work?

### ✅ Example: Booking a Hotel
1️⃣ User: *"I want to book a hotel."*  
➡️ Assistant detects intent → **Activates `book_hotel` workflow**  
➡️ `dialog_state = ["assistant", "book_hotel"]`  

2️⃣ User: *"Actually, I need to update my flight first."*  
➡️ Assistant switches workflow → **Activates `update_flight`**  
➡️ `dialog_state = ["assistant", "update_flight"]`  

3️⃣ User: *"Never mind, back to hotel booking."*  
➡️ Assistant **pops the last state** and **resumes hotel booking**  
➡️ `dialog_state = ["assistant", "book_hotel"]`  

This **dynamic routing** makes interactions **more natural and efficient**.

## 🏆 Benefits of Specialized Workflows

🔹 **Better User Experience** 🎯 – More accurate responses  
🔹 **Scalability** 📈 – New workflows can be added easily  
🔹 **Maintainability** 🛠️ – Code remains modular and organized
