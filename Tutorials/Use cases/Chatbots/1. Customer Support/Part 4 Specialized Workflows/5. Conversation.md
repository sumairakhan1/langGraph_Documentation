Great - now i want to figure out lodging and transportation.
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Sure, I can assist you with booking lodging and transportation for your updated travel dates in Basel. What are your preferences and requirements?

For hotels, some key questions:
- What are your desired check-in and check-out dates in Basel?
- Do you have a particular area or neighborhood you'd like to stay in?
- What is your preferred hotel budget or star rating?
- Do you need any specific room types (single, double, suite, etc)?
- Any other must-have amenities like free breakfast, gym, etc?

And for transportation:
- Will you need a rental car or transportation from/to the Basel airport?
- If a rental, what type of vehicle are you looking for? Any preferences on make/model?
- For how many days would you need the rental car?

Please provide those details and I can look into available hotel and transportation options that fit your needs and travel dates in Basel. Let me know if you need any other information from me at this point.

For your car rental needs in Basel from May 4th to May 11th, I was able to find availability for a midsize vehicle from Thrifty. The total rate for the 8 day rental comes out to $425, which fits the moderate pricing you requested.

Does the midsize rental from Thrifty work for you? If so, I can go ahead and confirm that booking. Or if you need me to look at any other rental car options in Basel for those dates, just let me know.
================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

Now for a car, what are my options?
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

For your rental car in Basel from May 4th to May 11th, here are a couple of the available options I found:

Midsize Vehicle from Thrifty
- Vehicle Class: Midsize (e.g. Toyota Corolla or similar)
- Pick-up/Drop-off: Basel Airport or City locations
- Total Rate: $425 for 8 days

Economy Vehicle from Europcar
- Vehicle Class: Economy (e.g. Volkswagen Polo or similar) 
- Pick-up/Drop-off: Basel Airport or City locations
- Total Rate: $375 for 8 days

I can provide some additional details on those rentals from Thrifty and Europcar if needed. The Thrifty midsize option was around $425 total, while the Europcar economy option is a bit less at $375 total for your dates.

Let me know if either of those rental options work for your needs in Basel. Or if you had a different vehicle class or rental company preference, I'm happy to check on additional availability as well. Just provide any other requirements you have for the rental car and I can get you some updated options.

Unfortunately I was unable to find any available guided hiking or biking tours through the vineyards and countryside around Basel for your specific travel dates of May 4th - 11th. It seems many of those tours may not be fully operating until later in the spring/summer season.

Since getting an outdoor excursion was important to you, I have a couple options:

1) I can look into other outdoor activity recommendations in Basel for early May, like city walking tours, park visits, river cruises, etc. 

2) If a vineyard/countryside hiking or biking tour is a top priority, I can check availability for later dates when those seasonal offerings are more active.

Let me know which direction you'd prefer - exploring alternative outdoor options for your May dates, or pushing the vineyard tour to later in the season. I'm happy to adjust my recommendation either way to find something fitting your interests.

# Conclusion:¶
You've now developed a customer support bot that handles diverse tasks using focused workflows. More importantly, you've learned to use some of LangGraph's core features to design and refactor an application based on your product needs.

The above examples are by no means optimized for your unique needs - LLMs make mistakes, and each flow can be made more reliable through better prompts and experimentation. Once you've created your initial support bot, the next step would be to start adding evaluations so you can confidently improve your system. Check out those docs and our other tutorials to learn more!

# 🚀 **Conversation Execution in a Multi-Agent Chatbot System**

This section explains how the specialized workflows and multi-agent system are **executed in a real conversation**. We'll walk through the code that simulates a conversation, describe each part in detail, and explain the purpose behind each code segment. This setup ensures that user inputs are processed, and if sensitive actions are to be executed, the user is asked for confirmation.

---

## 📌 **Overview**

- **Purpose:**  
  Run a conversation over multiple dialog turns with our multi-agent chatbot system.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - **State Restoration:** Uses a backup database to start fresh each time.  
  - **Unique Thread ID:** Distinguishes each conversation session.
  - **User Confirmation:** Pauses before executing sensitive actions for user approval.
  - **Event Streaming:** Processes each dialog turn and prints the responses.
  
- **Real-World Example:**  
  Imagine a travel booking assistant that processes a user's queries. It asks for confirmation before making changes like booking a flight or hotel, ensuring the user is always in control.

---

## 🔧 **Step-by-Step Code Explanation**

### 1. **Initialization and Configuration**

```python
import shutil
import uuid

# Update with the backup file so we can restart from the original place in each section
db = update_dates(db)
thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
```

- **`import shutil, uuid`**:  
  - **shutil:** For file operations (used to manage backups).  
  - **uuid:** Generates unique identifiers.

- **`db = update_dates(db)`**:  
  - **Purpose:** Updates the database with current dates.  
  - **Why?** Ensures that every run starts from a consistent state.

- **`thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())`**:  
  - **Purpose:** Creates a unique identifier for the conversation session.  
  - **Real-World Use:** Similar to a unique session ID in a web application, ensuring the conversation is tracked separately.

---

### 2. **Setting Up the Configuration**

```python
config = {
    "configurable": {
        "passenger_id": "3442 587242",  # Used to fetch user's flight information
        "thread_id": thread_id,         # Links conversation to the unique thread ID
    }
}
```

- **`config` Dictionary:**  
  - **`passenger_id`:**  
    - **Purpose:** Identifies the user so that flight-related tools can fetch their specific data.
  - **`thread_id`:**  
    - **Purpose:** Associates the conversation with a unique session, used for checkpoints and resuming conversations.

---

### 3. **Processing Each Dialog Turn**

```python
_printed = set()
# We can reuse the tutorial questions from part 1 to see how it does.
for question in tutorial_questions:
    events = part_4_graph.stream(
        {"messages": ("user", question)}, config, stream_mode="values"
    )
    for event in events:
        _print_event(event, _printed)
```

- **`_printed = set()`**:  
  - **Purpose:** Keeps track of printed events to avoid duplicate outputs.

- **Loop Over `tutorial_questions`:**  
  - **Purpose:** Simulates a conversation by processing each user query.
  
- **`part_4_graph.stream(...)`:**  
  - **Parameters:**
    - **`{"messages": ("user", question)}`:**  
      - Wraps the user’s question into a message.
    - **`config`:**  
      - Provides configuration (passenger_id, thread_id).
    - **`stream_mode="values"`:**  
      - Indicates that the output will be streamed (processed piece-by-piece).
  - **Result:** Returns a stream of events (responses from the chatbot).

- **`_print_event(event, _printed)`:**  
  - **Purpose:** Prints each event (response) while avoiding duplicates.

---

### 4. **Handling Interrupts for Sensitive Actions**

```python
    snapshot = part_4_graph.get_state(config)
    while snapshot.next:
        try:
            user_input = input(
                "Do you approve of the above actions? Type 'y' to continue;"
                " otherwise, explain your requested changed.\n\n"
            )
        except:
            user_input = "y"
        if user_input.strip() == "y":
            result = part_4_graph.invoke(
                None,
                config,
            )
        else:
            result = part_4_graph.invoke(
                {
                    "messages": [
                        ToolMessage(
                            tool_call_id=event["messages"][-1].tool_calls[0]["id"],
                            content=f"API call denied by user. Reasoning: '{user_input}'. Continue assisting, accounting for the user's input.",
                        )
                    ]
                },
                config,
            )
        snapshot = part_4_graph.get_state(config)
```

- **`snapshot = part_4_graph.get_state(config)`**:  
  - **Purpose:** Retrieves the current state of the conversation from the graph.

- **`while snapshot.next:`**:  
  - **Purpose:** Checks if there is an interrupt—i.e., if the graph is waiting for user confirmation before proceeding with a sensitive action.

- **User Confirmation via `input()`:**  
  - **Try/Except Block:**  
    - **Purpose:** Prompts the user to approve or deny the action.  
    - **`user_input`:** If the user types "y", it means approval; otherwise, the user provides a reason for denial.

- **Handling Approval:**
  ```python
  if user_input.strip() == "y":
      result = part_4_graph.invoke(None, config)
  ```
  - **Purpose:**  
    - **`invoke(None, config)`:** Resumes the graph execution with the current state because the user approved the action.

- **Handling Denial:**
  ```python
  else:
      result = part_4_graph.invoke(
          {
              "messages": [
                  ToolMessage(
                      tool_call_id=event["messages"][-1].tool_calls[0]["id"],
                      content=f"API call denied by user. Reasoning: '{user_input}'. Continue assisting, accounting for the user's input.",
                  )
              ]
          },
          config,
      )
  ```
  - **Purpose:**  
    - Sends a **ToolMessage** with the user's reasoning for denying the action.
    - This informs the chatbot to adjust its behavior accordingly.
    
- **Updating the Snapshot:**
  ```python
  snapshot = part_4_graph.get_state(config)
  ```
  - **Purpose:** Re-checks the state after processing the user's input. The loop continues until there are no more interrupts.

---

## 🔑 **Key Takeaways**

- **State Restoration and Unique Session:**  
  Ensures every conversation starts fresh and is tracked independently using `thread_id`.

- **Configuration:**  
  Passes necessary user information (like `passenger_id`) to tools for personalized responses.

- **Event Streaming:**  
  Processes each dialog turn, prints responses, and handles repeated outputs with `_printed`.

- **Interrupt Handling:**  
  Pauses execution before sensitive actions to ask for user confirmation. This is crucial for safety and user control.

- **ToolMessage for Denial:**  
  Sends a detailed message back to the system if a user denies an action, ensuring that the chatbot can adapt and continue assisting.

---

## 🌍 **Real-World Example**

Imagine you're using a travel assistant app to modify your flight booking:

1. **User:** "I need to change my flight to next Monday."
2. **Assistant:** Searches for available flights and prepares an update.
3. **Interrupt:** Before making the change, the assistant asks, "Do you approve of the above changes?"  
   - **User:** Types "y" if they agree, or explains changes if they don't.
4. **Assistant:** If approved, it completes the booking; if denied, it adjusts its actions based on the user's input.

This mechanism ensures that any **sensitive actions** (like modifying a booking) require explicit user confirmation, reducing errors and ensuring trust.

---

## 🎉 **Conclusion**

This code block simulates a real conversation with a **multi-agent chatbot** that:
- **Streams user queries and responses.**
- **Uses configuration to personalize interactions.**
- **Pauses for user confirmation on sensitive actions.**

By following this approach, you ensure that your chatbot is both **powerful and safe**, giving users full control over critical operations. This design is ideal for complex applications like travel booking, banking, or healthcare, where user consent is paramount.

Feel free to ask if you need further clarification or more examples! 😊


# 🚀 Running the Conversation in Our Multi-Agent Chatbot

In this section, we simulate an entire conversation using our **Part 4 graph**. The conversation runs through several dialog turns, handling user queries, and managing interruptions for sensitive actions—all while involving specialized workflows.

Below is the detailed code snippet with line-by-line explanations, examples, and real-world context.

---

## 🔑 Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  - To simulate a complete conversation with our chatbot.
  - To show how the graph processes each dialog turn and handles interrupts (user confirmations) for sensitive actions.
  
- **Real-World Example:**  
  Imagine you're using a travel assistant app. You ask questions like "What time is my flight?" or "Update my booking." The assistant processes your requests, but before performing a sensitive action (like changing a booking), it pauses and asks, "Do you approve?" This code simulates that entire interactive process.

---

## 📝 Code Example with Explanations

```python
import shutil
import uuid

# Update with the backup file so we can restart from the original place in each section
db = update_dates(db)
thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

config = {
    "configurable": {
        # The passenger_id is used in our flight tools to fetch the user's flight information
        "passenger_id": "3442 587242",
        # Checkpoints are accessed by thread_id (each conversation is unique)
        "thread_id": thread_id,
    }
}
```

### 🔍 Explanation:
- **`import shutil, uuid`:**  
  - `shutil` may be used for file operations (e.g., updating backups).
  - `uuid` generates a unique identifier for each conversation thread.
- **`update_dates(db)`:**  
  - Resets or updates the database backup so the conversation can start fresh.
- **`thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())`:**  
  - Creates a unique ID to track the current conversation.
- **`config`:**  
  - A dictionary that holds configuration details such as `passenger_id` and `thread_id`.  
  - These details help our tools fetch the correct user information and maintain conversation state.

---

```python
_printed = set()
# We can reuse the tutorial questions from part 1 to see how it does.
for question in tutorial_questions:
    events = part_4_graph.stream(
        {"messages": ("user", question)}, config, stream_mode="values"
    )
    for event in events:
        _print_event(event, _printed)
```

### 🔍 Explanation:
- **`_printed = set()`:**  
  - A set to track which events have already been printed. This prevents duplicate outputs.
- **`for question in tutorial_questions:`**  
  - Iterates over a list of pre-defined user questions.
- **`part_4_graph.stream(...)`:**  
  - Streams events (or messages) from the conversation graph for the given user query.
  - The `config` is passed to ensure proper state context.
  - `stream_mode="values"` tells the system to stream only the values (the responses) from the graph.
- **`_print_event(event, _printed)`:**  
  - A helper function that prints each event if it hasn’t been printed before.

---

```python
    snapshot = part_4_graph.get_state(config)
    while snapshot.next:
        # We have an interrupt! The agent is trying to use a tool, and the user can approve or deny it
        # Note: This code is all outside of your graph. Typically, you would stream the output to a UI.
        # Then, you would have the frontend trigger a new run via an API call when the user has provided input.
        try:
            user_input = input(
                "Do you approve of the above actions? Type 'y' to continue;"

```

### 🔍 Explanation:
- **`snapshot = part_4_graph.get_state(config)`:**  
  - Retrieves the current state of the conversation after processing the user's query.
- **`while snapshot.next:`**  
  - Checks if the graph is in an **interrupt state** (i.e., waiting for user confirmation before proceeding).
- **`try/except` block:**  
  - Prompts the user for confirmation using `input()`.  
  - If there's an exception (e.g., in non-interactive environments), it defaults to `"y"`.
- **`if user_input.strip() == "y":`**  
  - If the user approves (types `"y"`), the graph is invoked to continue with the current action.
- **`else:`**  
  - If the user provides an explanation (or denies the action), the graph is invoked with a **ToolMessage** containing the user's reason.
  - **`ToolMessage(...)`:**  
    - Includes the tool call ID to tie the message to the current interrupted action.
    - Contains a message explaining that the API call was denied and includes the user’s reasoning.
- **`snapshot = part_4_graph.get_state(config)`:**  
  - Updates the conversation state after processing the user's decision.
  - The loop continues until there are no more pending interrupts.

## 💡 Real-World Context

Imagine you're interacting with your travel assistant on your smartphone:
- **User:** "Update my flight to next week."
- **Assistant:** Processes your request and then pauses, showing the planned action and asking, "Do you approve?"
- **You:** Type "y" if you agree, or type "No, I want a different time."
- The assistant then either proceeds with the update or adjusts based on your feedback.

This interactive process helps ensure that **sensitive actions** (like updating a booking) are only performed with your explicit approval.

## 🎯 Summary

- **Setting Up:**  
  - We update our database backup and set a unique thread ID for the conversation.
  - A configuration object (`config`) is created to store critical user data.
  
- **Streaming the Conversation:**  
  - We iterate over a list of tutorial questions, stream the events from our conversation graph, and print them.
  
- **Handling Interrupts:**  
  - After each query, the graph's state is checked.
  - If an interrupt is detected (waiting for confirmation), the user is prompted.
  - The conversation continues based on whether the user approves the action or provides alternative instructions.

This process ensures that the chatbot's actions are transparent and under user control, improving both **security** and **user satisfaction**.
