### **Use Cases üõ†Ô∏è**  
Explore practical AI implementations tailored for specific tasks:  

#### **Chatbots üí¨**  
- **Customer Support Bot**: Train a chatbot for handling customer queries in various domains.  
- **Prompt Generation from User Requirements:**: Build an AI assistant that refines and generates prompts based on user inputs.  
- **Code Assistant**: Develop an AI-powered coding helper that analyzes and generates code snippets.  

#### **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) üß†**  
- **Agentic RAG:** Use an agent to figure out how to retrieve the most relevant information before using the retrieved information to answer the user's question.

- **Adaptive RAG:** Adaptive RAG is a strategy for RAG that unites (1) query analysis with (2) active / self-corrective RAG. Implementation of: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14403

For a version that uses a local LLM: Adaptive RAG using local LLMs

- **Corrective RAG:** Uses an LLM to grade the quality of the retrieved information from the given source, and if the quality is low, it will try to retrieve the information from another source. Implementation of: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15884.pdf

- **Self-RAG:** Self-RAG is a strategy for RAG that incorporates self-reflection / self-grading on retrieved documents and generations. Implementation of https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511.
